Obviously I think you should visit Asturias, but why? Let's look at the reasons — at what Asturias has to offer you, the foreign tourist — and why you should consider it as a vacation destination. Then we'll look at how to get here, where to go, how to get around, what to do, and where to eat and drink.
# Why Visit Asturias
Let's start with the fact that it is the most popular vacation destination in Spain for Spaniards. That's right, more Spaniards vacation in Asturias than anywhere else in Spain. When Madrid, Barcelona, and the *costas* fill up with foreign tourists, Spaniards head north, to the cool, green shores of Asturias.

Why? Because it is beautiful, the food is amazing, and the people are friendly. It is also a great value. You can eat and drink like a king for a fraction of what it would cost in other parts of Spain. The weather is mild and the beaches are beautiful. The mountains are stunning and the cities are charming. The history is rich and the culture is vibrant. The list goes on and on. Asturias is a great place to visit.

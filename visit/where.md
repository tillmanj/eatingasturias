Officially known as _Principáu d'Asturies_ or the _Principado de Asturias_, Asturias is an [autonomous community](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomous_communities_of_Spain "wikipedia:Autonomous communities of Spain") within the Kingdom of Spain.

The Mediterranean coast and the cities of Madrid and Barcelona capture the hearts and minds (and wallets) of most foreign tourists to Spain. In the know, Spaniards however flock to Asturias for both its rural character and its outstanding food and drink. Here’s what you need to know in order to join them.

Asturias is on the northern coast of Spain, nestled in between the regions of Galicia and Cantabria. They, along with the Basque Country, form _España Verde_, Green Spain. It is an excellent descriptor. What it is referring to is the part of Spain that has a temperate oceanic climate. So, here lush pastures and forests thrive, providing a landscape similar to that of Ireland, Great Britain, and the west coast of France.

Asturias, and much of the rest of Green Spain, is separated from the interior of the country by the Cantabrian Mountains (_Cordillera Cantábrica_). This creates a very mild wet climate, unlike most of the rest of Spain. This climate is perfect for growing fruits and vegetables, as well as raising cattle.

## Regions
Asturias is made up of roughly three regions, each corresponding to an area bounded by rivers. While in no way reflected in official or scholarly sources, this is my rough mental map of Asturias. I find it to be a useful way to think of the various parts of the region, and I hope it can help you to learn a bit more about the variation or experiences within Asturias. It can also be used to decide where you would like to spend your time in Asturias, as each region has it's own unique rhythm and flavor.

### Western Asturias

Made up of the [comarcas](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Comarca&action=edit&redlink=1 "Comarca (page does not exist)") of [Eo-Navia](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Eo-Navia_\(Comarca\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Eo-Navia (Comarca) (page does not exist)") and [Narcea](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Narcea_\(Comarca\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Narcea (Comarca) (page does not exist)"), this is the area between the Eo river on the border with Galicia and the lower reaches of the Nalón river and the Trubia river above that.

This is farming country, and very sparsely populated. It contains the only wine region in Asturias, the [DOP Cangas](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=DOP_Cangas&action=edit&redlink=1 "DOP Cangas (page does not exist)"). If you want a bucolic setting with wineries and stone houses with slate roofs, this is where you should go.

#### Cangas del Narcea

The economic center of the western third of Asturias, Cangas del Narcea is home to the [Cangas wine DOP](https://docangas.es/dop-cangas/?lang=en), a [number of wineries](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Asturian_Wine&action=edit&redlink=1 "Asturian Wine (page does not exist)"), and a wide variety of restaurants. It is an excellent place to base yourself when exploring the western third of Asturias.

#### Navia

Navia is a popular tourist destination, particularly among those looking for a slower, less crowded, beach experience. Known for it's dairy industry ([cheese](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/The_7_Different_Types_of_Asturian_Cheese "The 7 Different Types of Asturian Cheese")!), fishing port ([seafood](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Asturian_Seafood "Asturian Seafood")!), and [unique](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Reques%C3%B3n_con_miel&action=edit&redlink=1 "Requesón con miel (page does not exist)") [desserts](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Tarta_Venera&action=edit&redlink=1 "Tarta Venera (page does not exist)"). The most populous beach town in western Asturias is still miles less crowded than most places in the north.

#### Taramundi

The pioneers of rural tourism in Spain, the people of Taramundi have transformed their sleepy farming village into a eaters and hikers paradise. The cuisine here revolves around locally caught freshwater fish, game meats, and garden vegetables. The cheese and meat market here is a sight to behold.

### Central Asturias

Comprised of the comarcas of [Avilés](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Avil%C3%A9s_\(Comarca\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Avilés (Comarca) (page does not exist)"), [Gijón](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n "Gijón"), [Oviedo](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Oviedo_\(Comarca\) "Oviedo (Comarca)"), [Caudal](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Caudal_\(Comarca\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Caudal (Comarca) (page does not exist)") and [Nalón](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Nal%C3%B3n_\(Comarca\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Nalón (Comarca) (page does not exist)"), it lies between the Trubia and Sella rivers.

This is the industrial heart of Asturias, and the most densely populated area. All of the cities of Asturias are located here, as well as the majority of the cider [llagares](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Llagares "Llagares"). This is the bustling center, in more ways than one. If you are looking for festivals, walkable cities, and nightlife, this is your jam.

#### Oviedo

[Oviedo](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Oviedo_\(City\) "Oviedo (City)") is the capital of Asturias, and the center of Asturian gastronomy. From the [busiest daily food market](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=El_Font%C3%A1n&action=edit&redlink=1 "El Fontán (page does not exist)") in the region to the [epicenter of sidrería culture](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Calle_Gascona&action=edit&redlink=1 "Calle Gascona (page does not exist)"), Oviedo is a gastronomic destination. From the [oldest known document](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Ego_Fakilo&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ego Fakilo (page does not exist)") concerning food in the Iberian peninsula to the greatest concentration of pastry shops outside of Paris, you'll never be short of something good to eat or drink in Oviedo.

#### Gijón

[Gijón](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Gij%C3%B3n_\(City\) "Gijón (City)") is the largest city in Asturias, and the oldest continuously inhabited place in the region, with the oldest settlement dating to the sixth century BCE. A very popular destination for Spanish tourists in Asturias, Gijón has the liveliest nightlife in the region, and the most [craft beer](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Craft_Beer_In_Asturias "Craft Beer In Asturias") bars. The downtown waterfront plays host to the [largest cider festival in Asturias](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Fiesta_de_la_Sidra_de_Gij%C3%B3n&action=edit&redlink=1 "Fiesta de la Sidra de Gijón (page does not exist)") every August, and the traditional Asturian fish stew [Caldereta](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Caldereta_Asturiana&action=edit&redlink=1 "Caldereta Asturiana (page does not exist)") was invented here in 1894.

#### Avilés

[Avilés](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Avil%C3%A9s_\(City\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Avilés (City) (page does not exist)") is the somewhat forgotten third city of Asturias. While not on most tourist's itineraries, it boasts the prettiest _casco antiguo_ (urban center) in Asturias, as well as the most innovative architectural space in the region, in the form of the Oscar Niemeyer center. Formerly an industrial powerhouse during the [Asturian Coal Boom](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Asturian_Coal_Boom&action=edit&redlink=1 "Asturian Coal Boom (page does not exist)"), Avilés is now a underrated destination with a wide variety of restaurants and sidrerías, including some of the best in all of Asturias. The port of Avilés is the largest fish market in Asturias, and the quality of seafood in town is impeccable.

#### Langreo

[Langreo](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Langreo_\(City\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Langreo (City) (page does not exist)") is the fourth largest town in Asturias, and one of the most interesting. Formerly the center of the mining and steel industries in Asturias, it is in the midst of a post-industrial resurgence, with a large number of new and diverse restaurants opening, from wood fired pizza to excellent doner kebab. Langreo is notable for it's high concentration of craft beer bars and beer breweries, which sit side by side with some of the most traditional and welcoming sidrerías you will find anywhere. The [yearly beer festival](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Festival_Internacional_de_Cerveza_Artesano_de_Llangr%C3%A9u&action=edit&redlink=1 "Festival Internacional de Cerveza Artesano de Llangréu (page does not exist)") in Langreo is one of the largest in Spain, and one of the most fun.

#### Mieres

The other big mining town, [Mieres](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Mieres_\(City\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mieres (City) (page does not exist)") sits in the other mining valley from Langreo, and a friendly(?) rivalry between the inhabitants of these two valleys is a defining aspect of living in the _cuencas mineras_. Mieres is notable for having (in my opinion) the single nicest place to drink cider and eat pintxos in all of Asturias. Home to María Luisa García and Magdalena Alperi, and the birthplace of José Andrés, Mieres has no need to shout its culinary qualifications. Those in the know flock not just to the many traditional restaurants that line the pedestrianized downtown, but to the many hidden (and a few [not so hidden](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Monte_\(Restarant\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Monte (Restarant) (page does not exist)")) gems of _cocina de autor_ that dot the surrounding hillside villages.

### Eastern Asturias

Comprised entirely of the [Oriente](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Oriente_\(Comarca\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Oriente (Comarca) (page does not exist)") comarca, this is the are lying east of the river Sella, to the border with Cantabria.

This is cattle ranching Asturias, and the home of the world famous blue cheeses. It is also ground zero for active tourism in Asturias, with some of the best rock climbing and alpinism to be had in all of Spain. If you are looking for an international destination for outdoor pursuits, rugged landscapes, and "campervans welcome" signs, this is where you want to head.

#### Llanes

[Llanes](https://eatingasturias.com/index.php?title=Llanes_\(City\)&action=edit&redlink=1 "Llanes (City) (page does not exist)") is a very pretty (and popular) medieval fishing village. As a popular tourist destination, it can be crowded during the summer, but the vibe when every restaurant and bar in town is full and merry and the sun is down is something worth experiencing.

#### Arenas de Cabrales

If you have heard anything about Asturian food, it is probably [Cabrales Cheese](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Cabrales "Cabrales"). This is where you can get up close and personal with it! The DOP headquarters is here in this charming vacation village, along with an excellent cheese cave tour, and the yearly _Certame del Quesu Cabrales_ the last Sunday in August. For those who like to combine gluttonous eating and drinking with strenuous mountaineering, this is your place!

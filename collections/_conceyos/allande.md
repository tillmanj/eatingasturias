Allande is a small conceyo in the west of Asturias, partially bordering Galicia. The population of roughly 1,800 work mainly in agriculture and forestry.

The area is known for salazones, [butiello](/culture/products/embutidos/butiello.html), [chosco](/culture/products/embutidos/chosco.html), and wild game dishes of all sorts. Hazelnut pastries such as tarta de avellana are the most notable desserts in the area. In recent years, several new dishes such as meat-stuffed cabbage, *pastel de verduras* and *tortilla al ron* have emerged.

Allande is part of the Cangas DOP wine region, and grows mostly white grapes (Albar√≠n, Albillo, and Small Grain Muscat)

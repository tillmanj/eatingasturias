The home of the eponymous *queso Cas√≠n*, this is a mountainous and agricultural area of Asturias unmatched in the wildness of its landscape, which has become a tourist attraction in its own right. Indeed, much of the conceyu is within the Redes Natural Park and is a UNESCO biosphere reserve. If you want to see what farming and village life (and food) were like in Asturias before industrialization, Caso is one of the best places to experience it.

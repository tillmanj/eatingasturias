This is seafood country! But before we get to that, it's important to note that Carreño has been growing corn and potatoes longer than most anywhere else in Asturias. 16th century and 18th century, respectively. Early adopters of these foods from across the sea, there is a local landrace of white beans they prefer in their [fabada](/recipes/soups/fabada.html): *Fabes de Carreño*. They also claim to be the inventors of *Fariñón*, a version of Morcilla made with corn meal.

However, it is seafood that defines Carreño. From fatty tuna and bonito in all forms to the ever popular *Sardinas a la Plancha* and *Merluza a la Sidra* to the massive and impressive *Mariscadas* (mixed seafood platters to share), the quality of seafood here is outstanding. So much so that many factories have sprung up to can and export the local seafood to the rest of Spain.

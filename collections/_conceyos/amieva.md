Amieva is half of the home of queso los Beyos. They have a rivalry with neighboring Ponga about which concejo it originates in. Amieva hosts the Certamen del Queso los Beyos yearly. Sopa de h√≠gado (pork liver soup) is one of its most popular dishes. Salmon and trout are also common in Amieva, as are pork and wild game dishes.

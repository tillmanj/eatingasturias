Cudillero is one of my top recommendations for where to visit on an initial visit to Asturias, particularly if you come during the summer. Widely considered in Spain to be one of the most beautiful villages in the country, Cudillero is primarily a tourist town.[^1] This means you have a higher chance of finding waiter, hotel clerks, taxi drivers, and shop keepers who speak English here than just about anywhere else in Asturias. Legend claims the town was originally settled by vikings, but the absolute lack of a single artifact confines this idea to "dubious at best" category.

Local gastronomic highlights include Pastel de Cabracho and Curadillo, a sun-dried fish (once small sharks, now almost always catfish) that is cured over months before being used in recipes.

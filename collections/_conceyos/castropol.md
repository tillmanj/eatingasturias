The location of Castropol, along the Eo estuary provides oysters, clams, razor clams and a great variety of mollusks and other crustaceans. There is also an abundance of diversity in rock, inshore and offshore fish, which makes it possible to taste dishes such as Almejas a la Marinera and Fabes con Almejas, baked sea bass, grilled sea bass, sea bream "al espalda", hake casseroles, monkfish "a la gallega", etc.

The mountains too play a crucial role in the gastronomy. Sausages, game meats, pork products and the products of the orchard abound.

Castrillón plays a part in my journey from Appalachia to Asturias, in that it is a major point of origin of immigrants who went the other direction at the end of the 19th century. As chronicled in the book *Pinnick Kinnick Hill/Las Colinas sueñan en español*, huge numbers of workers from the mines around the village of Arnau moved to West Virginia at this time to work the zinc mines there, as the ones at home were petering out.

That immigration wave started an intermingling of food (and other) customs that led me to remark a century later on how similar in feel, if not in exact form the food I grew up with and the food I found in Asturias were.

Its most important ingredient is strawberries. They’re used in a variety of dishes, and they have a *Festival de la Fresa* every June. In November they have a chestnut festival. They’re also one of the concejos where the *Afuega’l Pitu* cheese is produced. Seafood is vastly important to their local gastronomy, with *langosta*, *llocántaro*, *ñocla*, *percebes*, *oricios*, *roballiza*, *bonito*, and *congrio* making up the bulk of the local dishes here. *Berces con Fariñona* is a locally popular version of Pote. Popular desserts here include *Leche Presa* and *Marañuela*.

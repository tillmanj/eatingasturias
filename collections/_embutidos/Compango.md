{% marginfigure 'mf01' 'assets/images/products/Compango.jpeg' 'the "holy trinity" of Asturian cooking is the three most common meats that make up a good compango: chorizo, morcilla, and panceta' %}
It is impossible to talk about food in Asturias without talking about _compango_. It is something of a holy sacrament in Asturian cooking; second only to *[sidra natural](/culture/products/cider/)* in the seriousness of even casual discussions of how to make or enjoy it.

## Origin & Meaning
*Compango* is not an Asturian word, per se. It is however, rarely used outside Asturia. This is a place where things change only slowly, so to understand the word, like much of Asturian cooking, we must first understand the medieval European diet. 

Europe in the middle ages was dominated by bread. Rice, corn, and potatoes (those other three types of complex carbohydrates) were still unknown in Europe. Wheat, oats, spelt, barley, and rye were the carbohydrates available, and they made up 80-95% of a medieval persons diet. That bread (up to 3kg a day!) was accompanied by liquids: broth, wine, cider, beer. Any solid food that was not bread was referred to as *companagium*; things that go with bread.[^1]

The purpose of the companagium (*companaticum*/*companĭcus*) was to add flavor and variety to the meal. Broadly speaking, companagium was either of vegetal or animal origin. Obviously, the vegetal was more common, and consisted primarily of home-grown garden vegetables (cabbage, onion, leek, carrot, parsnip, turnip...) greens and herbs (once again home-gown; spinach, sorrel, mustard, garlic, celery, nettles...) or foraged (mushrooms, nuts, rosehip, sorb, medlar...). The rarer and more precious was companagium of animal origin. Dairy, eggs, fish, and domestic animals (primarily pigs) contributed to this.

## Good & Bad Compango
The first, and most important caveat is this: the compango you assemble yourself will almost always be superior to the compango you buy already assembled.

## Uses
The most famous use of _compango_ is, of course, in _fabada_. However, it is an indispensable part of Asturian cooking, and the longer I live here, the more uses I find for it.

You can slice it and fry it to put on top of your _[fariñes](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Fari%C3%B1es "Fariñes")_ (grits), toss it into your lentils (or any other beans) instead of a ham hock, or grill it up and serve it with some bread as a _parillada_ (cookout).

Andoya is a similar sausage to chosco, being also made with whole loin. However, it is a different sausage because of the curing process. First marinated in salt, paprika, white pepper, and oregano. It is then held in this marinade for five days. After that, it is cased and fermented. Its shape is sort of a flat chosco. It is typical of the Asturian southwest.

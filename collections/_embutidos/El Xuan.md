Another unique sausage here. Actually two unique sausages, that share a name. The first variety of el xuan is a variety of blood sausage. Begin with the same ingredients as the morcilla asturiana, above. To this, add cooked pumpkin and green chilis.

The other version of el xuan is essentially a smoked pork chop in sausage form. Take super fatty pork chops. Grind them up. Then marinate them in a mixture of paprika, garlic, and salt. Ferment, then smoke, like many Asturian sausages.

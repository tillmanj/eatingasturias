Like in the rest of Spain, the most popular sausage is always some variation on chorizo. Asturias has an abundance of chorizos. Surprised? Supposedly Spain has only one chorizo. The real authentic chorizo. Right? That’s what the internet says. Well, the internet is wrong. Multiple chorizos exist in Spain. Heck, there are multiple chorizos just in Asturias. Here are the most widespread, and most popular:

## Ahumado de Asturias
Chorizo Asturiano sausage is made with pork loin and bacon, salt, sweet and spicy paprika, oregano and garlic. Cured first for between 15 and 90 days, then smoked over oak. I have already said a lot of good things about this sausage.

_Chorizo asturiano_ is an uncured sausage, and is smoked, usually over oak. The very best kinds in Asturias bear a serious resemblance to the kind of smoked sausage you get in really good diners in the States. You can easily substitute any of the major brand “Chorizo. Smoked sausage” types you find in the average grocery store.

## Criollo
Asturians have a very deep love affair with all things Argentinian, especially on the barbecue grill. This Argentinian cook-out staple found a second home in Asturias. From there it has conquered most of Spain, one grill at a time. You can find it in pretty much any butcher shop or grocery store in the province. The Asturian version is usually about 30% pork and 70% beef.

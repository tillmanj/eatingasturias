Like in the rest of Spain, the most popular sausage is always some variation on chorizo. Asturias has an abundance of chorizos. Surprised? Supposedly Spain has only one chorizo. The real authentic chorizo. Right? That’s what the internet says. Well, the internet is wrong. Multiple chorizos exist in Spain. Heck, there are multiple chorizos just in Asturias. 

These are the most widespread, and most popular varieties of chorizo in Asturias.

## Ahumado de Asturias
Part of the reason for this is how adapted to local tastes the sausages in Spain are. Asturian chorizo is pretty unique from the other chorizos of Spain. However, that unique property will be familiar to most Americans. Like Americans, Asturian smoke everything! 

Made with pork loin and bacon, salt, sweet and spicy paprika, oregano and garlic, it is cured first for between 15 and 90 days, then smoked over oak. 

The semi-cured specialty of the region tasted both familiar and new when I first bit into one in 2014. With a snap and and a firm but yielding inside, it reminded me of the vaguely named “smoked sausage” one can get in diners all over the States. That diner sausage, split in half and friend on the griddle, has hints of “Italian sausage” and Kielbasa in its heritage. That was the familiar bit, the memory it stirred. But, also full of sweet Spanish paprika (_pimentón_) and identifiable chunks of alternating meat and fat, this was undeniably a _chorizo_. That was very foreign to my American palate.

I was intrigued by this marriage of the familiar and the foreign, and I have remained so. I’ve learned a lot about sausages in the intervening years, and a little about the Asturian – Appalachian food exchange that took place throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. I’ve learned about heritage pigs and backyard smokers. And through this unique sausage, I’ve come to see a microcosm of what I talk about on this site. [Hernando de Soto](https://exploration.marinersmuseum.org/subject/hernando-de-soto/) took pigs to Georgia, the Carolinas, and across the Appalachian mountains into the eventual Tennessee.[^1] Dried chiles made their way back to Spain and eventually became the _pimentón_ that no _chorizo_ can exist without. Hundreds of years later, Asturians moved to the Appalachian mountains to work in the mines and found local people there who ate as they did and drank as they did, and loved pork and apples in equal measure.

And now I’ve gone from the Appalachians to Asturias for precisely the same reasons; work, apples, pork, and a food culture that is both familiar and foreign. That’s why a little smoked sausage is so special. To me at least.
## Criollo
Asturians have a very deep love affair with all things Argentinian, especially on the barbecue grill. This Argentinian cook-out staple found a second home in Asturias. From there it has conquered most of Spain, one grill at a time. You can find it in pretty much any butcher shop or grocery store in the province. The Asturian version is usually about 30% pork and 70% beef.

## Picadillo
This uncased, uncured chorizo is wildly popular in Asturias. So much so that I have given it [it’s own entry](/culture/products/embutidos/picadillo.html). Go find out why.

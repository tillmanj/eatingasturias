{% newthought 'The internet is full of people'%} who love to go on and on about the difference between ‘Mexican chorizo’ and ‘Spanish chorizo’. Guess what? They’re all wrong, and anyone who has ever visited Spain knows it. 

Spain has a huge variety of sausages called [chorizo](/culture/products/embutidos/chorizo.html), and plenty of them are uncured, just like the famous Mexican one. Spain has cured chorizos, uncured chorizos, and uncased bulk chorizos, just like Mexico. Here in Asturias, that bulk uncured chorizo mix is called *l’adobu* or *picadillo*.[^1] In other parts of Spain, it goes by the names *jijas*, *zorza*, *moraga*, *chichas*, or *prueba*.[^3]

Picadillo in Mexico however refers to a [dish made from ground beef](https://www.cocinavital.mx/recetas/carnes-y-aves/picadillo/2017/08/), carrot and potato that looks very similar to a Midwestern [hamburger hash](https://dinnerthendessert.com/hamburger-hash/). Funny how something as simple as a word can separate people. It would be ridiculous to say there is no such thing as hamburger hash in Mexico simply because the local name is different, now wouldn’t it? 

## Asturian Picadillo
{% marginfigure 'mf01' 'assets/images/Map_Iberian_Peninsula_910-es.svg.png' 'The Kingdom of Asturias in the year 910 is a pretty good outline of where *picadillo* is popular today' %}
Particularly popular in Asturias, Galicia, León, Palencia, Burgos, and Valladolid, picadillo is exactly what goes into a cured chorizo, just uncased. When making chorizo, people cooked a small amount of the mix to check the final outcome and taste balance. From this practice, picadillo was born. 

Picadillo is available throughout Asturias, from local butchers to foreign-owned hypermarkets. It is impossible for me to imagine a butcher in Asturias that didn’t have at least one type of picadillo available every second they were open. Many will have three or more kinds; normal, *picante*, *de jabalí*, etc…

## Samartín
If anyone needed concrete proof of how deeply agricultural the Asturian mind is, *Samartín* is the perfect explanation. Putting aside for a moment how Martin of Tours became so widely venerated in Asturias, let’s instead look at the word in Asturian. *Samartín* has variously meant at one time or another:

- slaughtering pigs,
- the season when you slaughter pigs,
- the stuff you make from pigs,
- the specific day that you plan to slaughter pigs,
- November 11th,
- the month of November.[^2]

Regardless, Samartín was the time when picadillo was traditionally made, and if you go back far enough, the only time it was available to eat. It became a popular dish during the matanza (hog slaughter), which occurred at that time. During that season, people typically served it accompanied by fried eggs and either potatoes or *[tortos de maíz](/recipes/breads/tortos-de-maíz.html)*, a way still popular today in the valleys of the Caudal and Nalón rivers.

For what it is worth, the Diccionario General de la Lengua Asturiana [agrees with him](https://mas.lne.es/diccionario/palabra/78226), though in all the usage I have encountered, no one has ever said *zorza* to me, only *picadillo*.

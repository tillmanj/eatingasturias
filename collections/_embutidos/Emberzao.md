The emberzao is a very unique sausage. It is cased with cabbage and not intestine or synthetic casing. This makes it rather more of a cabbage roll than a sausage to me, but Asturians say it is a sausage, so I guess it is! It is part of a family of sausages that also includes pantrucu, bolla, boroncho, and fariñón. All of them are variations in blood sausages. Some are more like morcilla, some less so. Each is defined by the starch component that is added. Some have corn flour, some have wheat flour. Others have rice or corn meal.

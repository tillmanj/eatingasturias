Some chronicles of Noreña say that in 1799, Doña Cipriana Rodríguez Sotura invented moscancia as an accompaniment to the typical chickpea stew.[1] It differs from morcilla. Beef or lamb tallow is used in addition to blood, bacon, onion, paprika, garlic and salt. Stuffed into natural casings and blanched, it is eaten mostly in cocidos and other stews.

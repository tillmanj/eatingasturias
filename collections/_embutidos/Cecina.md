{% marginfigure 'mf01' 'assets/images/embutidos/Cecina_EA.jpeg' '*Cecina* is more popular in Asturias (and neighboring León than *jamón*)' %}
Everyone knows about Spanish _jamón._ The most famous of all Spanish foodstuffs is ubiquitous and best-loved all over the country. Except in the northwest, where people prefer _cecina_. Think of it as a beef jamón. It is made following the same techniques as _jamón_ – salt curing and air drying. However, for _cecina_, beef is used, and an additional step of smoking takes place between the salt curing and air drying. Of course it does, right? Asturians love smoking meat! While more commonly associated with the province of León to the south, Asturias is also prime _cecina_ country. While no protected status exists in Asturias, it is definitely produced here. Some of the nicest, most artful _cecinas_ are to be found in village markets all over Asturias.

## Production

Drying meat in the wind is probably the oldest way of preserving it. For at least 10,000 years humans have been doing so, and refining their techniques.[^1] That makes _cecina_ one of the oldest foods known.

In León, there are two different quality marks for _cecina_. There is an IGP for [beef](https://www.cecinadeleon.org/) and a separate quality mark for goat from the village of Vegacervera. This village, and its goat _cecina_ is famous throughout Spain. In Asturias there are several small producers and a single large producer/retailer (Crivencar).

## Enjoying

In many parts of Spain, _cecina_ is eaten primarily on its own, perhaps drizzled with a little bit of olive oil. It is also very popular in both León and Asturias as an ingredient in winter soups and stews. In that case, it is usually re-hydrated first and then cubed and added to the soup.

I enjoy adding it to all sorts of things, and have made a habit of making pizza with it. Paired with some blue cheese, it makes a very Asturian version of the world’s favorite food.

## Finding _Cecina_

You can find many mail order companies that ship to all of the EU, so European visitors wanting to try this delicacy will have no problems. Unfortunately, like many European cured meats, it is not possible to import _cecina_ into the United States. You will have to eat your fill on your next trip to Asturias.

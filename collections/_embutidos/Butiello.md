Imagine a chosco, but made with short ribs instead of whole loin. That is butiello, and its Leonese neighbor botillo. 80 or 90% short rib, mixed with 10-20% pig tail. It does not share the IGP designation that its neighbor to the south has. Instead, it is protected only by its relative obscurity. However, it is well worth hunting down.

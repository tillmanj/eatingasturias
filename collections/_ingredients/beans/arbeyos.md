*Arbeyos* can be a bit of a confusing word, as it requires context to know if the speaker is talking about green garden peas (_Pisum Sativum_) or common vetch (_[Vicia Sativa](https://plants.ces.ncsu.edu/plants/vicia-sativa/)_).[^1] For our purposes, we are going to assume we are speaking of Garden Peas - the Castellano _guisante_. The common garden pea. L'arbeyu is an integral part of Asturian early spring cuisine. It stars in the dish Arbeyos con Jamón, famous in Lena conceyu because of the arbeyos grown in the village of Llanos in the parish of Somerón.

## History

Originally a wild plant growing throughout the Mediterranean Basin, there is solid evidence of their use as a foodstuff since the late neolithic era.[^2] Grown initially for their dried seeds, the pea was selected into many cultivars from roughly 7500 BCE until 300 BCE.[^3] From Roman legions gathering peas to supplement their rations to Charles the Good of Flanders noting their key role in averting famine in 1124, the pea remained a constant and important part of European culinary history.[^4] As a cool-season crop, they are an ideal plant for the Asturian climate. Since it rarely gets above 85F in [Asturias](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Asturias "Asturias"), even in the hottest parts of the regions, peas grow well almost year-round.[^5]

## Cultivation

Arbeyos are usually planted between November and January and harvested in May, when they are tiny and perfect. Many folks seed them continuously from November to March and enjoy them throughout the spring and summer. The preferred cultivars are of two types. [Alderman](https://www.seedaholic.com/pea-alderman.html), [Teléfono](https://www.smartgardener.com/plants/933-peas-tall-telephone/overview), and [Lincoln](https://www.smartgardener.com/plants/640-peas-lincoln-garden/overview) are all late-bearing vine types.[^6] Express is a mystery to me, as I have not found it for sale in Asturian garden shops, and the only named variety I can find is a [yellow seeded variety](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.4141/cjps89-106).[^7]

In Llanos de Somerón, high in the mountains, they are famously harvested in September.[^8] This late crop is prized for it's particularly fatty and meaty texture. IT certainly doesn't hurt their reputation that they are the only fresh peas available in the market at that time!

## Uses in Asturian Cooking

In the Asturian kitchen, arbeyos take the pride of place that esparragos has in other parts of Spain - as the herald of spring and the beginning of the fullness of gardening season. Nowadays used only fresh (or fresh frozen), they are prepared in a variety of ways. From simply boiled with potatoes (echoes of the southern Appalachian dish _Ham, Peas, & New Potatoes_[^9] to an essential part of Menestra, to slow cooked with ham or bacon, to boiled and served along with Carne Guisada, the pea is ever-present in the Asturian repertoire.[^10]

[^7]: Alderman and Tall Telephone are considered the same cultivar in most of the US. It is possible that Teléfono is not the Tall Telephone cultivar, however. I have found [one reference](https://www.infoagro.com/hortalizas/guisantes.htm) to it as a particularly North American development so I am mostly confident that Teléfono and Tall Telephone are the same.

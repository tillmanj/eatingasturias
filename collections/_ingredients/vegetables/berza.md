Wild *B. oleracea* is a tall biennial or perennial plant that forms a stout rosette of large leaves in the first year. The grayish-green leaves are fleshy and thick, helping the plant store water and nutrients in difficult environments. In its second year, a woody spike grows up to 1.5 metres (5 ft) tall, from which branch off stems with long clusters of yellow four-petaled flowers.[^1]

Throughout the Roman and Medieval periods, *B. oleracea* made up an enormous portion of the average diet through the varieties cabbage, kale, cauliflower, kohlrabi, brussel sprouts, and broccoli.[^2]

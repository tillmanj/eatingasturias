**_Brassica oleracea_ var. _viridis_ L.**- collard greens. _Berza_ (also _berces_) is the most-loved leafy green vegetable in Asturias. An essential ingredient in *pote*, this garden staple is one of the oldest known vegetables in Asturias. Add to that, as someone who moved to Asturias from the southern United States, it was comforting to discover that collard greens are as popular in Asturias as in Appalachia. Walking around villages here, seeing that much like home there are greens in every garden, made the place seem less foreign.

Cabbage, kale, broccoli, and cauliflower are all forms of a single polymorphic species, _Brassica oleracea_. Berza, or collard, is the closest extant variety to the primitive cultivated cabbage of middle ages Europe. The tight headed cabbages we have today were developed during the Renaissance.[^1]

For those who might not know, "greens" in hillbilly parlance means any cabbage where the leaves don't make a compact head. They are the cabbage version of leaf lettuce (vs. head lettuce). Where I am from, we cook and serve greens in a quantity known as "a mess". A mess of greens is the quantity necessary to feed everyone coming to supper. That quantity will vary, of course, based on the size of your family. It is not uncommon to measure uncooked greens by the sackful. A sack being a grocery store bag. One sack should feed three or four people.

But I digress. We are discussing _berza_, not _collards_, even if for Linnaeus they are the same. So, we are going to bypass all of the fascinating history of how cooking collards fused European indigenous proto-cabbages to west African cooking traditions. For the low-down on that, I refer you to the indefatigable Jessica B. Harris, writing for the exemplary _[Gravy](https://www.southernfoodways.org/green-i-love-you-greens/)_.
## History
Berza or its predecessor has grown in Asia since at least the late Bronze Age.[^2] It is known in the eastern Mediterranean by the time of Theophrastus.[^3] Through the Hellenistic period, at least, no distinction is made between collards and kale. Indeed, collards are a subtype of the _acephela_ variety, and the modern collard greens had yet to become a distinct cultivar.[^4]

The English settlers in America brought this primitive collard with them. Then called "colewort", it later morphed into the word collard. "Wort" was the old English term for a plant of any kid, and "Cole" came from the Latin _caulus_ - 'stem' or 'cabbage'.[^5]

However, there is a serious lack of sources concerning Asturian food until relatively recently. A variety of reasons, from the lack of Visigothic texts, and a general disinterest in the food of the peasants, of which all of Asturias essentially was until industrialization. There is some recent work using stable isotopes to determine a medieval Asturian food web.[^6]

In wider Spain, we can find _pucheros_ and _potes_ attested from at least 1520 that contained what would have been indistinguishable from modern berza/collards.[^7] From these, we can infer that pote made with berza would have existed in Asturias long before written records of Asturian foodways.
## Cultivation
Wild *B. oleracea* is a tall biennial or perennial plant that forms a stout rosette of large leaves in the first year. The grayish-green leaves are fleshy and thick, helping the plant store water and nutrients in difficult environments. In its second year, a woody spike grows up to 1.5 metres (5 ft) tall, from which branch off stems with long clusters of yellow four-petaled flowers.[^8]

## Uses in Asturian Cooking
Asturian cooking, or at least its traditional component, is very recipe driven. Each ingredient has its place in the repertoire, and it rarely ventures outside those dishes. Primarily it shows up in soups. It plays a supporting role to beans in these dishes. Pote Asturiano is the most famous. In neighboring León, you can find a version of this soup made with the addition of carrots and leeks. In addition, it is sometimes used in Asturias paired with garbanzo beans.

Berza is somewhat common in baking in Asturias as well. In place of a clay or metal dish, whole collard leaves are often used when baking breads such as *panchon* or *boroñu*.

I continue to make them primarily the way I grew up - slowly simmered with smoked ham hocks and dressed with peppery vinegar. However, I am branching out, and fusing the two cuisines together as I go.

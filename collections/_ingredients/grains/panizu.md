{% newthought 'El Panizu has gone by many names.'%} Previously known scientifically as *Panicum italicum*, and colloquially known in parts of Asturias as *sara* or *pamplina*,[^1] **foxtail millet** (as it is currently known in English) is one of the oldest known cultivated grains on Earth.[^2]

In Asturias it was widely cultivated as a summer crop until the 16th century along with [Proso millet](/culture/ingredients/grains/miyu.html). Once maíz from South America began to be planted, the acreage given over to both types of millet plummeted, and eventually settled into a trio of summer cereal crops; maíz, panizu, miyu, to complement the three winter cereal crops: escanda, trigu, centenu.

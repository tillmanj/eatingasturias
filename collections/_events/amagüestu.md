{% epigraph 'Magüestu per Navidá y fuxó la señardá' 'Xulio Viejo Fernández' 'Paremias populares asturianas (Estudio, clasificación y glosa), pp153' %}

Until the Columbian Exchange, chestnuts were the staple winter food in Asturias.[^1] With the arrival of the potato they fell out of favor as the primary winter calorie store. However, they retained their position as an important part of Autumn. The celebration that now bears this name was originally an integral part of ‘laying up stores’ for the coming winter.

What was once the labor of the whole family – collecting chestnuts to store for winter food – became a celebration. A celebration of not having to scavenge chestnuts and of getting to enjoy them as a treat instead.

## Etymology

Amagüestu is Asturian for toasting chestnuts. To _magostar_ is to toast or roast something. The most common usage is to mean “to roast chestnuts outside in a drum”.[^2] When that verb becomes a noun, it is masculine, and masculine nouns in Asturian usually end in -u. Prepending A- to things is a regional pattern where some masculine words have their _el_ smashed into them, and sounded as an _a_. The written El magüestu is first spoken as elmagüestu. That becomes amagüestu following the sound.

## History

Amagüestu is a tradition with a murky past. While it is certainly possible that it is a pre-Christian festival, as is often claimed online, there is no solid evidence to support such a supposition ,so we must discard the idea in favor of verifiable facts.

The folklorist Aurelio de Llano places the earliest mentions in the medieval period, in which the chestnuts would be roasted directly in the embers of the weeds being cleared from pastures and fields in the autumn.[^3]
## Current Celebration

Modern Amagüestu celebrations are held between the first and eleventh of November. In parts of Asturias bordering Galicia, the date is most likely to be the 11th (feast of San Martín).

Now, it is the name for any celebration involving said chestnuts. Every school age child in Asturias looks forward to that cold Autumn day when it is their turn to celebrate at school. Chestnuts are roasted in huge drums, and eaten out of paper cones, accompanied by sidra dulce, the lively carbonated apple must that has not yet become alcoholic. It may be the only time of the year that any celebration in Asturias contains a non-alcoholic beverage!

School children often make costumes patterned on traditional village dress from days gone by. Shepherds costumes are particularly popular, and tie the celebration (sometimes unknowingly) to the transhumance aspects of [Samaín](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Sama%C3%ADn "Samaín").

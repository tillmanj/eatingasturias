Acebal is a 100+ year old family-run business dedicated to the production, bottling and distribution of traditional natural cider. In addition to the llagar, they run a well-loved [sidrería](/visit/sidrerias/) (El Tasqueru) attached to the llagar.

## History

Founded at the end of the 19th century by D. Benito Acebal. At the beginning it was a farmhouse operation, with production intended for family and friends. His son, nicknamed El Fraile build the current warehouse, and installed the industrial presses – thought to be the first used in Asturias.

The third generation took over in the 70s and spent the 80s modernizing the bottling process and investing in machinery. Prior to this all of the cider had been bottled completely by hand. At the beginning of the 90s, the fourth generation took charge of the llagar. They were the first to concentrate solely on the cider business. They continued the previous generations strong committment to the incorporation of new technologies.

Gradually they replaced the old chestnut wood barrels with new fiberglass and stainless steel tanks. Further modernization of the bottling line resulted in greater efficiency based on increased production. They also designed the current label. In 2002, Sidra Acebal was one of the founding llagares of the Protected Denomination of Origin Sidra de Asturias. However, it was not until 2007 that they launched El Carrascu, their DOP marked cider for the first time.

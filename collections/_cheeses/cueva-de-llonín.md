An outlier among Asturian cheeses, this is one of the few local cheeses that remind one of Brie or Camembert. Cueva de Llonín Cheese is made by the Cooperativa quesera de Peñamellera, located in the town of Alles, capital of the Asturian conceyo of Peñamellera Alta.

The cooperativa takes one base recipe, and from it creates four distinct cheeses. This particular cheese was first made in 2000, and has become something of a cult favorite in the decades since.

## Where Is It From?

Peñamellera Alta is a mountainous conceyo in the eastern tip of Asturias. It is prime Asturian cheese country, and along with the neighboring conceyos of Peñamellera Baja and Cabrales, makes up on of the most dynamic and forward-thinking areas of cheese production in Spain.

## How Cueva de Llonín Is Made

Initially, its method of production is practically identical to that of the traditional Peñamellera cheese. However its subsequent maturation process gives it characteristics similar both in appearance and texture to those of the popular French Brie or Camembert cheeses. Like Camembert, it is made in small wheels, with a stark white fuzzy rind, and readily melts, unlike a Brie.

## History

First produced in the year 2000, Cueva de Llonín is one of the newer cheeses on the Asturian block.

Using pasteurized cow’s milk, and finished for 45 days, this is a shining example of the new directions Asturian cheese making has begun taking in recent decades.

## Uses For Cueva de Llonín

**Common Uses**: It is actually quite rare to find this cheese in a restaurant cheese selection. At home it seems to be mostly eaten as is, which is the best way of course, with most cheeses.

**How I Use It**: This is essentially an Asturian version of Camembert, and I treat it precisely as such. It melts readily, unlike a Brie style cheese, so I am fond of encasing the whole wheel in puff pastry and baking it to create a luxurious dip for crackers. I also enjoy substituting it for cream in a pasta dish, like a simple mushroom and cheese pasta. I also like it as a filling for croquetas, and as a marinated canapé.

## Where To Find Cueva de Llonín

Cueva de Llonin is available throughout Asturias in the better supermarkets (Al Campo / Hipercor) and in specialist cheese shops. Mail order is available in Europe through all of the usual suspects.

Unfortunately, I am unaware of an American importer of this particular cheese.

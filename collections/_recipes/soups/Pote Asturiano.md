recipeIngredients:
  - 300g [Fabes de la Granja](/culture/ingredients/beans/fabes.html) (*extra-large cannellini beans*)
  - 1 large bunch [Berza](/culture/ingredients/vegetables/berza.html) (*collard greens - 20 large leaves, about 1.5lb*)
  - 2 [Chorizo Asturiano](/culture/products/embutidos/chorizo.html#ahumado-de-asturias) (*cured, smoked chorizo*)
  - 1 [Morcilla](/culture/products/embutidos/morcilla.html) (*blood sausage*)
  - 500 g [Tocino](/culture/products/embutidos/tocino.html) (*Pancetta or slab bacon*)
  - 500 g [Lacón](/culture/products/embutidos/lacón.html) (*smoked pork shoulder*)
  - 3-4 large potatoes
  - 1 bay leaf
  - salt (*a three-finger pinch*)
requires: 
recipeInstructions:
  - The night before put the dried fabes in the slow cooker with the bay leaf and the salt, and fill the slow cooker almost full with water. Cook on low overnight.
  - The next morning wash and chop your berza and add it to the pot along with all of the meats.
  - After an hour, add your three potatoes, cut into chunks, and cook on high until the potatoes are tender; 60-120 minutes.
recipeNotes:
  - You can absolutely make this on the stove-top without a slow-cooker, but why would you? The Asturian wood-fired cookstove is designed to act almost identically to the slow-cooker, so arguably the most authentic style of preparation is with a slow-cooker.

Pote is not one soup. It is hundreds of soups. That is, it is a style of soup making that does not have a fixed single recipe. Originally named for the pottage common across all of medieval Europe, it is today defined as a particularly Asturian and Galician version of the Spanish type of pottage, known as *olla podrida* or simply *olla*. 

Today pote is more similar to the *cassoulet* of France than to the olla podrida of middle Spain. This recipe makes use of a slow cooker. You can make it without one by soaking the beans overnight and assembling the remainder the next day.

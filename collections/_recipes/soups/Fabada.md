recipeIngredients:
  - 1 kg [Fabes de la Granja](/culture/ingredients/beans/fabes.html) (*extra-large cannellini beans*)
  - 4 [Chorizo Asturiano](/culture/products/embutidos/chorizo.html#ahumado-de-asturias) (*cured, smoked chorizo*)
  - 4 [Morcilla](/culture/products/embutidos/morcilla.html) (*blood sausage*)
  - 500 g [Tocino](/culture/products/embutidos/tocino.html) (*Pancetta or slab bacon*)
  - 500 g [Lacón](/culture/products/embutidos/lacón.html) (*smoked pork shoulder*)
  - 1 ham bone
  - pinch of Saffron
  - Salt (to taste)
requires: Compango
recipeInstructions:
  - Find 8 to 10 trustworthy friends. They must be hearty eaters (*fartures* in Asturian), enthusiastic conversationalists, and never in a hurry. Set a date for lunch with them and mention that they should make no plans for after lunch that day.
  - The night before your luncheon, cover the dried beans in plenty of water and soak overnight. In a second pot, cover the *lacón*, ham bone, and *tocino* with an equal amount of water.
  - In a very deep pot, combine the beans (along with the water that have soaked in) and the bacon, ham, and ham bone from the other pot (but not the water they have soaked in)
  - Prick the sausages a few times each and add them to the pot, along with additional cold water necessary to cover all the ingredients generously. Place the lid on the pot so that a gap exists between the two to allow steam to slowly escape.
  - Over low heat; at a very lazy boil or just below, gently cook the soup for as long as is necessary for the beans to become edibly soft, but not overcooked. Frequent monitoring is important!
  - Once you judge that the beans are **almost** ready, add a couple of strands of saffron to the pot and give the pot a gentle slosh, moving it back and forth gently but firmly so as to combine all the various liquids in the pot without stirring. Stirring too much at this point can ruin both the beans and the morcilla.
  - Taste your soup and add salt as needed. Avoid the temptation to "adjust" the flavoring in any other way. We are practising orthodoxy here --- this is no place for innovation.
  - Remove the ham bone. Scoop out a ladle full of the beans into a small frying pan and mash them finely with a fork. Add to this a small piece of butter (and another few saffron threads if you are felling rich) and fry gently until bubbly. Stir this gently into the fabada to provide a little thickener.
  - Allow the soup to rest, off the heat (or over a pilot light if you have a gas stove with them) until it develops some body. About an hour is good. Use this time to put your bottles of *[sidra natural](/culture/products/cider/)* in cold water to chill, or to decant your red wine from Rioja if that is your pleasure. (*Wine is a good accompaniment as it takes as long for a good red to breathe as it does for a fabada to rest.*)
  - With a slotted spoon or tongs remove the meats from the soup and slice them into nice large chunks. Arrange them as artfully as you can on a platter to be served alongside the beans. this is called *[compango](/culture/products/embutidos/compango.html)* and it is an ancient and important part of eating fabada. It allows each diner to determine the ratio of beans to meat that they prefer, and is a hallmark of convivial eating.
  - Slice nice big hunks of the best bread you can procure into a basket to be placed on the side of the soup pot opposite the *compango*.
  - Call the diners to the table, pour the first drinks, and begin.

{% newthought 'So beloved is fabada'%} in Asturias that it is nearly impossible to find someone living here who does not eat it on a regular basis. Despite its relatively recent debut in Asturian gastronomy it is both the most loved dish in, and the most recognizable symbol of, Asturian cooking.[^2] If someone knows a single thing about Asturian food, it’s fabada. 

I know of no other dish, anywhere, that can inspire so many words with so few ingredients. There are at least two (and likely more) books published solely about how to properly prepare this most loved dish.

## Notes
[^1]: *Aquel platonazo que está más adelante vahando me parece que es olla podrida, que por la diversidad de cosas que en las tales ollas podridas hay, no podré dejar de topar con alguna que me sea de gusto y de provecho*
[^2]: The first reference to Fabada as a restaurant dish is from 1884 in the _El Comercio_ newspaper. See {% cite MendezRiestra2017DiccionarioCocinaGastronomia -l 258 %}
[^3]: from _[popurrí](https://dle.rae.es/?w=popurr%C3%AD)_ and the colloquial meaning of _[podrido](https://dle.rae.es/podrido)_: “having a lot of…”
[^4]: “_…in the days of the Inquisition, when every man’s Christianity had to be restated daily if he were to survive, it became customary in Spain to ensure that there was always either pork in the cauldron or the dried pork sausage called chorizo hanging from the rafters as a sure proof that no Jew or Muslim lived or ate in the house._” {% cite Tannahill1995FoodHistory -l 241 %}
[^5]: See [this interesting article](https://wamu.org/story/14/12/12/steeped_in_tradition_the_story_of_the_senates_signature_soup/) for a small history of, and the official recipe for, Senate Bean Soup, which to my eyes looks like Fabada with only ham.

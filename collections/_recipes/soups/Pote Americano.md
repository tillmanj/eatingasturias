recipeCourse: First
recipeIngredients:
  - 300g dried white Great Northern beans
  - 1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped
  - 2 medium carrots, peeled and finely chopped
  - 1 small fennel bulb,, cored and finely chopped
  - 2 stalks celery, finely chopped
  - 3 cloves garlic, peeled and minced
  - 30ml olive oil
  - 1 small green cabbage, cored and sliced into thin ribbons
  - 60g tomato paste
  - 1.5l chicken broth (*homemade, canned, or from cubes. Use whatever you have.*)
  - 2 [Chorizo Asturiano](/culture/products/embutidos/chorizo.html#ahumado-de-asturias) (*cured, smoked chorizo*)
  - 1 [Morcilla](/culture/products/embutidos/morcilla.html) (*blood sausage*)
  - 500 g [Tocino](/culture/products/embutidos/tocino.html) (*Pancetta or slab bacon*)
requires:
recipeInstructions:
  - Soak your beans overnight in a large pot, throw in a fist full of kosher salt, and add cold water until it is a couple of inches higher than the beans. Leave them overnight, then drain and rinse them when you are ready to begin your recipe.
  - Set your slow cooker to high, and add the oil. When it has warmed enough to shimmer, add your onion, carrot, fennel, celery, and garlic.
  - After 30 minutes or so, add your tomato paste, stock, and beans. Leave the slow cooker to do its thing for 7-8 hours.
  - Once the beans are soft, add your shredded cabbage and your [compango](/culture/products/embutidos/compango.html). In one hour, your pote will be ready.
recipeNotes:
  - You can absolutely chuck everything (except your suasages) into the slow-cooker and let it go all night. I prefer to discard the bean-soaking water as it is said to reduce flatulence, but whatever you prefer is perfectly fine.

Ok, so pote is a big deal in Asturias. A BIG deal. Think Texas State Fair BBQ and Chili Cook-Off big deal. Pote has the same level of competitive cooking to it here in Asturias. So of course, I have to throw my hat into the ring and offer up my very own ***Pote Americano***.

Briefly, pote is the Asturian and Galician equivalent to *olla* (as in olla podrida) in Castilla, and *cocido* in Madrid. That means it is not a single dish, but a complex of dishes. It is a [direct descendant](/culture/history/early-modern/pote.html) of the *pottage* that comprised the majority of peasant and laborer cooking in the middle ages. Its closest American equivalent is “pork and beans”, and a southern variation on that dish is my starting point for this recipe.

Oviedo is the seat of government in Asturias, so I suppose it isn’t too odd to christen the favorite dish of the city “Government Beef”. Carne Gobernada is the classic work-a-day lunch in Oviedo. You can find variations on this recipe that are much closer to a British or American Pot Roast or Stew Beef. Those come with carrots, two types of peppers, and leeks, and all sorts of other things. But in Oviedo, they stick to a classic preparation. Beef, Onion, Garlic, Wine. Serve it with the ever-present french fries on a white plate.

The slow cooker is not a very popular _electrodomestico_ in Spain. I discovered this when I tried to replace my beloved Crock Pot when I moved here. I ended up having to import a German brand, which has served me well. It is a pity they are not more popular here. It’s odd, as Spain (and Asturias in particular) is a country of stews and slow simmered soups. _Platos de cuchara_ – literally “spoon dishes” very much define Asturian and Spanish cooking. Many classic recipes in the region are much improved, or at least made easier, by adapting them to this humble appliance.

In quite a few Spanish cookbooks outside Asturias, you can find a similar dish referred to as _Batallón_ – Battalion Stew. That sense of it being a military dish helps to explain the origin of the name _carne gobernada_. Mostly because the military is not a popular institution in Asturias, to put it mildly. And, in the mining valleys (where I live) it is common to find it called _carne tabierna_. That sometimes leads to it being listed interchangeably with *[Carne guisada al estilo chigre](recipes/meat/beef/carne-guisada-al-estilo-chigre.html)* on menus.

Originally popularized (in Asturias) at the restaurant Casa El Rey (sadly now closed) and [Casa Amparo](http://restaurantecasamparo.com/), _carne gobernada_ rapidly spread throughout the region. So, most version you find in restaurants hew very close to the onion-heavy style popularized by those restaurants. And that is the one I present here.

A limited edition of the first batch of cider of each year, and available only for a month or two, De Pura Madre is JR’s homage to the old ways of cider making.

Once upon a time in Asturias everyone made cider at home. That cider was not as refined and filtered as what most people now think of as sidra natural. Homemade cider in Asturias was (and for those who still make it, is) an unfiltered product, fermented at higher temperatures, and stored in the barrel pretty much until consumption. That creates a different flavor profile and experience. A few llagares, JR among them, have begun bottling their first run of the year *sin trasegar* – without filtering. The result is a rougher, more homestyle cider. 

## Tasting Notes
Big bold cider flavors. Nothing refined or elegant about this. I very much enjoy the tension of the apple flavors with the wine-y aspects of the still developing alcohol. Slightly more bitterness than expected.

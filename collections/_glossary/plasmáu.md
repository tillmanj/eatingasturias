{% epigraph '<span class="left">Pensatiple...plasmáu...silenciosu<br />com‘l pitu a la vista del raposu</span><span class="right">Pensive... stunned... silent<br />like the chicken at the sight of the fox</span>' 'Teodoro Cuesta' 'Andalucia Y Asturies' %}

{% newthought 'Plasmáu is a negative' %} term to describe cider that has no liveliness when poured into the glass.[^1] Essentially this is how to say that a cider is flat and lifeless.[^2] A cider that is *plasmau* is lacking in the essential carbonic gas necessary to make the required small bubbles when poured from overhead (see [escanciar](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Escanciar "Escanciar")).

It is sometimes used to describe a cider that was good, or very good, but is missing, for an inexplicable reason, a certain something that would make it great. When used in the process of making (as opposed to drinking) cider, it is used to talk about a cider that can be recovered, and restored to it's greatness before the process is finished.[^3]

In his 1870 poem _**Andalucia y Asturies,**_ Teodoro Cuesta, the poet son of Mieres begins with the refrain at the top of this page.[^4] That image, of being stunned, struck, set immobile --- these are good ways to translate *plasmáu* - the state of being struck into motionlessness. And that is the complaint about cider described as such. A good _sidra natural_ should be lively: in the glass and on the tongue. And if it isn't the former, it certainly won't be the latter.

Synonyms include _apagao_ and _apaxarao_.

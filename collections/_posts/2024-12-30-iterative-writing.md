One of the questions that pops up frequently when I discuss the history of this site and it's trajectory through different types of software is why it isn't just a blog. "Why don't you just use Wordpress?" is a common enough question that I have developed something of a canned response to it at this point. And while the canned response is true and good enough for most situations, it isn't the whole story. So here's a little more on the thought process behind the website, and how I develop it.

## What Is A Blog?
{% marginnote 'mn-iterative-01' 'So rare is reverse chronology in writing that outside of ephemeral things like news bulletins, there are no notable examples between Virgil’s *Aeneid* in the 1st century BC and W. R. Burnett’s *Goodbye to the Past* in 1934.' %}
A blog is, literarily speaking, an aberration. It is a piece of reverse chronological writing, in which each discrete section of writing is atomized, unconnected, and utterly without context. They are novelty machines more akin to small-town news bulletins than to any other kind of writing. They are not the province of sustained, careful, writing. That is why every instance of reverse chronological writing, every blog (these development notes included) has a super structure of tags and categories and other loose attempts at imposing structure *post hoc* to the *ad hoc* nature of the writing in it.

Blogs have their place. They are excellent for status updates, news stories, and cynically feeding the dopamine-driven timeline doomscroll machine for profit. Their place is, however, not in investigating a topic deeply or carefully. So this website is **not a blog**.

## Hypertext is King
I believe wholeheartedly in the superiority of hypertext over nearly every other form of non-fiction writing ever devised by humans. I am a [Vannevar Bush](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/227181.227186), [Ted Nelson](https://livinginternet.com/w/wi_nelson.htm), [Tim Berners-Lee](https://home.cern/science/computing/birth-web), and [Mark Bernstein](https://www.eastgate.com/garden/Enter.html) true believer. Links, indexes, serendipitous connections, and emergent information that does not follow a single predefined reading path are exactly what I want from what I write.

I believe that my freedom as an author to link a single phrase to an entirely new article that expounds on that phrase *ad nauseum* is just as important as your right, as a reader, to completely ignore my pedantry and sail smoothly on to the next portion of the story you are interested in. If I as an author think carefully about what the minimal necessary text is to provide the story, and break everything else out into other articles with their own minimal necessary text to tell *their* particular story, then you, the reader with complete agency, can decide your own path, choose your own adventure, through the hypertext web I have weaved.

## How I Write
I have [talked a bit previously](/news/2024/12/15/some-notes-on-a-writing-process/) about how I maintain an outline for this website, which contains at least the kernel or nub (or is it stub now) of each and every article that will one day be included on the site.

Every day I take some bit of that outline, polish it a bit more than it was the day before, fill it out a bit more, and if it is sufficiently to my liking, put it on this website.

But, my interaction with that bit of the outline, that document, that now web page, does not end there. As I read, hear, eat, think, and experience more, new things come to light. And I attempt to be diligent in revising what I have written before -- adding new information, removing spurious assumptions, sometimes breaking out a paragraph into a whole new article of its own.

This iterative nature is fundamental to how I write, and an absolute necessity for what I am attempting to accomplish.

## How To Read
However you would like. I aim to provide as much (or as little) information on the relatively narrow but very deep topic of Asturian food culture as you would like to read. To do so, I develop some simple patterns that allow for navigation by the big broad topics in my outline. and offer increasingly granular detail as you descend through the inverted pyramid. I try to organize my articles from least to most specificity, to allow you to choose your own adventure through them. Enjoy!

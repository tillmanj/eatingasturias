Perhaps this topic doesn't merit its own post, simply because if this site [isn't a blog](/news/2024/12/30/iterative-writing/), then it probably doesn't need comments. But, lots of other types of sites have comment sections, and whether or not to have one is a decision everyone making a website has to make, so here is my thinking on the subject.

## What A Comment Should Be
Ideally, a comment on a website would be well-informed, and tell the author of the website something they didn't know that was directly related to the topic. It would point to a new source of research on the topic, or suggest factual corrections by pointing out a factual error, pointing to an authoritative source, and demonstrating some familiarity with the topic. It might expand on a smaller point in the article with a well-written paragraph or two that demonstrated the comment authors special knowledge of the minor point, and provide a jumping-off place for other readers interested in it.

## What A Comment Usually Is
A comment in actuality is a far different thing than the ideal above. At best it is a tangential thought inspired by, but only barely related (if at all) to the topic of the article. It exists primarily to allow the comment author to have an audience for their flight of fancy. At worst (and far more often) a comment is mere polemic, focused on one or more of:

- politics (invariably US politics) and their seeming applicability to every topic on Earth.
- the comparative superiority or inferiority of this or that culture, food, dish, ingredient, or other individual choice.
- presumptive comments on the race, gender, ethnicity, intelligence, national origin, passport color, creative ability, or mental state of some other commenter, or the article author.
- questions about why the author isn't covering **topic X** which is a special subject of interest to the commenter and of no interest to the writer.

## Moderation
The problem with allowing the second type of comment is that while it might be good from a business analytics standpoint to drive *engagement* at all cost, I do not run this website as an exercise in business analytics optimization. It is a passion project with a focus. It is not a "conversation" about Asturian food culture, it is an exposition of my understanding of and interest in, Asturian food culture. It is not a group project.

Moderating a comment section is hard work. Not only do you have to read a whole bunch of stuff that other people have written, that is probably not germane to the topic at hand, and remove the irrelevant, you then have to answer messages and emails from people who are affronted by the fact that you have removed their very important comment.

I have a smallholding that feeds and otherwise provisions my family, this full-time writing endeavor, and two children that I try to spend as much active time with as possible. I simply have no time, nor desire, to run a general discussion forum for the benefit entirely of other people.

## Better Alternatives
Instead of a comments section under every article I write, I have implemented a system that allows people to comment on, or respond to, things that I write **elsewhere on the web**, and automatically notify my website that they have done so. Old people reading this might recognize that as Trackbacks or Pingbacks. Yes, that is the idea I am talking about, if not the exact technology.

I use WebMention, a [W3C Recommendation](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) to automatically manage display of responses mentioning my articles elsewhere on the internet. Anyone who writes about my site can ping me with a WebMention either directly or using a service, and that response will get filed under the correct article.

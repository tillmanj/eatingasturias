{% newthought 'Welcome to the first' %} of what will hopefully be many weeknotes documenting the Eating Asturias web project.

## What's a weeknote?
Weeknotes are notes about what I have been doing this week (specifically concerning Eating Asturias --- for farming and personal weeknotes, see [my personal site](https://jontillman.me/now/)). They are a part of my plan to work in public with this project; to make the process transparent and open.

## Successes This Week
1. I finally got a bunch of random notes and scribbles about the project out of the seven different places I have thrown them and dumped them all into the project [wiki](https://github.com/tillmanj/eatingasturias/wiki) on Github. I should be dumping all of my more structured notes on there over the next month or so.
2. The last major technical hurdle (mapping) has been dealt with, and all existing content from the old (MediaWiki) site can now be ported over to Jekyll without delay. How long that will actually take I have no idea. I am really attempting to go slowly and carefully this time. Though, how much slower can I possibly go? I started this move into Jekyll two years ago and am only about 1/3 of the way through the content...
3. I am slowly making better use of [FrontMatter](https://frontmatter.codes/). I've been using the basics of it for a while now, but I've made a concerted effort this week to dive in a little deeper and see how much of it can be useful to my development.

## Challenges This Week
1. Time. Always time. I assume this could be the first entry on every one of these weeknotes from now until the end of time, so I'll just put it here on the first one and then never speak of it again. Dividing my day up so that I have time to work on the site every day is challenging, to say the least. Between full-time small-holding farming, two kids with after school interests I make a priority, and working very hard to keep my weekend work free, there is not nearly as much time for work on the site as I would wish. How many pandemic projects suffered this fate?
2. Dislike of social media. I really want to be better about posting things via BlueSky and PixelFed, but my brain simply doesn't work that way. I don't think "broadcast first". I file things away in silent little drawers; I don't throw them out into everyone's timeline. I'd like to change that a little bit though --- share out the things I find interesting throughout the week.
3. Weather. The recent stormy time in the Iberian peninsula and France has really eaten into my work time. Cleaning up after wind storms, making preparations for potential flooding, and general heightened anxiety about immediate *climate change* impacts have really slowed me down.

## Looking Forward to Next Week
- Having recently made a spreadsheet of all the remaining content to move from MediaWiki to Jekyll, I now have a way to make *number go up*, which hopefully will provide some extra motivation: enough to at least distract me from The Last Caretaker when my willpower starts to wane.

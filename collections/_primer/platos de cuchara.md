{% newthought 'Platos de cuchara'%} is a surprisingly hard term to translate, and for that reason, it is one of my favorites, as it shows how differently we think about and mentally categorize foods depending on where we are from.

The most succinct definition I can make is "*first courses meant to be eaten with a spoon, that are not a part of a larger dish.*"[^3]

These dishes run the gamut from simple broths and boullions (_caldo_) to hearty stews (_estofados_ and _guisos_). Let’s dive into the murky world of Spanish one-pot cooking and see what we can fish out of the stew in the way of definitions. First, a warning. The Spanish language is not one of incredible specificity. Particularly not when it comes to nouns related to food. Definitions are fleeting for most of the terms below, and the number of exceptions many times outweighs the number of exemplars. That, to me, is reason alone to try to make some sense of it.

## Asturian One-Pot Cooking
One-Pot cooking is the heart and soul of Asturian food. While the rest of Spain might serve a vegetable dish followed by a meat dish, Asturias tends to put everything together. To me, it is one of the best things about Asturian cooking. 

### Broth and Stock – _Caldo_

At the most elemental end of things, we have broth or stock. While often used interchangeably, there is a subtle difference.[^4] I put them here together as _caldo_ for two reasons. Firstly, because in Asturias (and Spain) there is no difference and we are talking about Asturian food.[^5] [^6] And secondly because the difference is so slight as to be of absolutely no interest to the home cook.[^7] [^8]

#### Pedantic Distinctions

A broth is made by simmering meat and/or vegetables in water, often with herbs, or other aromatic added. Broth is also a relatively quick thing to make, usually taking an hour or less to make. You can drink broth plain. Many people do just that as a cold remedy.

Stock, on the other hand, is made by simmering bones and/or cartilage in water. The point is to free the collagen in the bones or cartilage and infuse it into the water. This requires a much longer cooking time. Stock-making in a restaurant can be a multi-day process. Even at home, it is not uncommon for a good stock to take 24 hours to prepare. Traditionally, you aim to make as neutral a stock as possible, cleaning the bones of any meat and roasting them before beginning the stock making process. Neutral stock like that has no added vegetables or herbs, and is for adding mouthfeel to a later dish. As I said before, no one really actually cares about those distinctions unless you need to differentiate between "things used to make classical sauces, braises, or _daubes_ in a French Restaurant" and "things used to make soups and _consommé_ in a French restaurant".[^9] [^10] Another way is think of the American pedantic definition of Broth as court bouillon, and stock as bouillon, which is the most likely origin of the confusion.[^11]
### Pottage – _potaje_ or _pote_

Historically, a pottage was a thick soup or stew made by boiling vegetables with grains, and sometimes meat.[^12] Pottage was essentially **the** medieval food. You could say that pottage is what existed before there were soups and stews – when we cooked everything together and hoped for enough calories, and maybe a little flavor if we got lucky. These days, the only surviving American example is succotash.[^13] Technically, we should call any modern soup or stew that has grains cooked in the pot with the other ingredients a pottage. In many places, Spain included, _potaje_ now means something completely different.

Nowadays in Spain a _potaje_ (_pote_ in Asturian) is a brothy soup containing beans of some sort. To that you add vegetables or starches – which ones depends on the region of Spain you find yourself in.[^14]

In Asturias, a _pote_ (or, less frequently, a _potaxe_) is a soup made with beans and greens. Often made with potatoes, but also without. Collard greens (_[berza](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Berza "Berza")_) are preferred, but others are used as well.

### Soup – _Sopa_ or _Cocido_

You can make the simplest soup by removing the meat used to make a broth, chopping it up, and adding it back to the broth. That is the basic recipe for chicken soup. From that base, you can make more complicated soups. However, they all retain the same basic meaning. They are a dish whose main component is liquid. From cream soups (_purés_ and _cremas_) to chunky chowders and elegant _bisques_, they are all soups. Yes, _cocido_ is a soup.

Like in English, Spanish has many words for specific types of soups. Creamy soups, pureed soups, chunky soups, and on and on.

### Stew – _Guiso_ or _Estofado_

Unlike a soup, a stew is not a liquid with solid things in it. It is much more of a plate of solid things with a lot of sauce on them. A stew starts out looking like a chunky soup, but is cooked low and slow for long enough to reduce all the liquid into a thickened gravy. Stews can contain other liquids than stock or both. Wine is common in stews. A handy guide to figuring out if what is in front of you is a soup or a stew is to ask yourself “can this be served on a plate?” If it can, it is almost certainly a stew. If it requires a bowl, it is probably a soup.

Pretty much every _estofado_ recipe I have seen in Spain is a stew. _Guiso_ is a more complicated thing. Many times a _guiso_ in Spain is just a chunky soup, so it is not as simple a translation.

## Important Asturian Platos de cuchara
There is no shortage of *platos de cuchara* in Asturian cooking. However, some rise above the others and achieve the status of exemplars of Asturian cuisine. It is worth looking slightly closer at those.

### El Pote
Despite not being served or presented in the same way as other cocidos in Spain, I am reliably informed[^1] that *el pote* is definitely a type of *cocido*, having the same common ancestor in the medieval *potaje / pottage*[^2], and that the style of serving is not the defining feature.

What’s more, that same definition lays out a basic definition: a *cocido* made of potatoes, beans, and [berza](/culture/ingredients/vegetables/berza.html) (collard greens). 

This stew, being served all at once instead of in three parts like many other *cocidos*, definitely counts as a *plato de cuchara*.

I have several pote recipes to share, including a pre-Columbian [pote de castañes](/recipes/soup/pote-de-castañes.html) with chestnuts in place of potatoes, a very traditional [pote asturiano](/recipes/soup/pote-asturiano.html) that you might find in a village bar-restaurant, and a slow-cooker interpretation of my own called [pote americano](/recipes/soup/pote-americano.html) that makes reference to the pork and beans traditions of the southern United States.

### Fabada
[Fabada](/recipes/soups/fabada.html) is the most recognizable dish in Asturias, by far. It is the single dish that every tourist wants to eat when they visit, and a constant on the tables of home and restaurants throughout Asturias during the colder months.

This hearty stew of white beans, ham and sausages has a [fascinating history](/culture/history/early-modern/fabada.html) of it’s own that I invite you to read to get a better sense of the importance of the stew to Asturian culinary identity.

A stock, which is also a broth or a bouillon, is basically some meat, game, poultry, or fish simmered in water with bones, seasonings, and vegetables."

I am fascinated with *processes*; with how people do the things that they do. I like to hear them talk about the tiny details that, through experience, they have come to find are the most important parts of their workflow, and how those tiny moments of decision or craft add up to a finished product that is what they intended it to be.

That last part is the most important to me. To have something you are making become *what you intended* it to be is the true reward of any craft - maybe of any activity at all. By paying some attention (but not too much[^1]) to our processes, and thinking about how to improve them, we can become *crafty* - good at what we are doing in a way that has a better than average chance of what we are making becoming what we intended. Knowing that makes me very conscious of my own processes, with how I am approaching things.

Since this website is a writing project, most of my process is focused on the discipline of writing. I gather information, synthesize it, and produce written articles that (hopefully) provide something of value to those who read them. There are several parts of this process, and looking at them in turn might be edifying to someone other than me, and will help me to think concretely about my process in order to explain it, so here goes:

## Purpose
Without a purpose, there can be no direction and no guiding principle. Every project has to start by answering the question "what's the point?" 

For me, the point is to capture the cuisine and culture of my adopted home. I chose this place, on purpose, and moved here at great expense, leaving behind 40 years worth of cultural knowledge and understanding, to plunge myself into a strange and unfamiliar place. And I did so in large part because of the food culture. This is perhaps at its simplest, what I am trying to do: to explain to people where I come from what it is about the food and food culture here that made me up sticks and move.

## Information Architecture
Information architecture (IA), at its base, is the discipline of making information findable and understandable. It is about laying out relevant information that users are seeking in a way that makes sense to the user.

I started this website in 2020 with **The Outline**. I still use that outline every day. It is the defining document for this project. It determines what topics are in the project and which ones are outside the scope of the project. Its form contains all of the layout and organizational decisions made to organize this website and all the content within it. For all intents and purposes, it **is** my information architecture.

I maintain the outline by setting aside time once a week to look it over. I also keep a little note with things I have come across during my research and writing that aren't already in the outline but perhaps should be. A new craft brewer has sprung up in Moreda, or I've run into an old timer at a bar with stories about how butchers in Asturias have their own particular argot for talking about cuts of meat that is different than the terms they use (in Asturian or Castilian) to sell those same cuts to the public. Time to think about whether those merit inclusion is important!

This outlines helps to keep me **focused**. By working on the outline separate from the process of researching or writing about any particular subject, I put in place limits on how quickly it can grow. It helps to rein me in. *The more you add, the larger the subject becomes, and soon it’s about everything and nothing in particular.*[^2]

## Research
Starting with the Outline as my guide, I pick a topic and begin my research. That research comes in two flavors; general and focused. Both are important to my writing, but are different enough to merit discussion separately.

Regardless of whether I am doing general or focused research, I find it most useful to set aside a specific time to read. And for me what works is to set aside 45 minutes or so every weekday morning to read and annotate something. Whether it is a research paper, a book chapter, or a newspaper story, I follow the same general flow. I follow the classic 3 Pass concept for reading academic matter. The idea is to read the paper (or whatever) three times, each of which has specific goals. The first is to get a general idea of the paper and decide if it merits further study. The second pass lets you get the gist of the paper without getting into the weeds. The third is a close reading with a lot of attention to detail.[^7]

### General Research
General research is what I call gathering facts or just "making notes". I read widely, both in food studies, and in general. I read a lot of what the {% glossary DDC %} calls "general works" - anthologies, specialist dictionaries, narrowly focused encyclopedias. When I read these, I mark up the text much as I would with more focused research. The difference is that I am not looking for anything in particular, more just trying to find interesting tidbits here and there that might relate to any of the various topics on the site.

For this purpose, I use [Zotero](/news/2024/12/12/a-toolchain/#zotero) and leverage a couple of very cool features in it to begin loading up a virtual card file of sorts. Basically, it allows me to store an electronic version of the book, journal article, or other text, along with my annotations of the text in a single database. Careful tagging of annotations allows me to "assign" them to a topic within the Outline. Then, when I work on that topic in the Outline, I can quickly pull up all of the notes I have made on the topic across all of my reading, along with a copy of the source document. I find this enormously powerful.

### Focused Research
When addressing a specific subject, I like to focus narrowly on the topic, and do more of what might be considered classic research and study. This usually involves reading journal articles, marking them up, and synthesizing the notes I make into something approximating an outline of the topic. This topic outline then gets added to The Outline as the framework for a future article. As in my general research, careful tagging of annotations in Zotero allows for instant recall of the notes on the topic once I get around to actually writing.

### Skepticism

Research does not mean passing along secondhand information or repeating well-worn but uncited cultural myths as fact. The plural of anecdote is not data.[^3] Food seems (to me at least) a topic full of hyperbole, wishful thinking, and plain exaggeration. Origins of customs or events are particularly suspect in food writing. Spanish scholarship in general between 1939 and 1975 is what was allowed by the censors of a fascist dictatorship, and should be viewed as propaganda first and potentially true as a distant second.[^6] Add to that the fact that lying about cuisine and culture had been official Spanish policy since the previous dictatorship in the late 19th century.[^5] Taken together, you do not have much reason to trust much of what counts as food scholarship for more than a century in Spain.[^4]

## Notes
[^1]: Project management has the term "process paralysis" and overthinking has been rebranded as "analysis paralysis". Both are what I like to think of as **meta-paralysis**: the state of being so involved in getting ready to do something that you never actually do it. Worrying about whether or not there might be a better tool out there, rearranging your files constantly in the hopes of having the perfect organizational structure. As Montesquieu said _Le mieux est le mortel ennemi du bien_.

[^4]: The Pact of Forgetting (*pacto de olvido*) in Spain not only allowed politicians to continue on in their posts regardless of their positions in the fascist dictatorship, but made a public sin out of questioning anything that was done during the dictatorship. There has been little effort put into reevaluating the intellectual output of the country during those years, and culinary 'facts' and 'origins' invented wholesale throughout the two dictatorships are widely accepted within Spain, even when evidence published by the dictatorships themselves lays out the invented origins. Food is but one (very minor) aspect of the forgetting. Much more important (and instructive of the totalizing way the Pact has shaped modern Spain) are the human rights abuses that no one wants to address. The Emmy-winning film *[The Silence of Others](https://thesilenceofothers.com/)* is highly recommended if you want to dig into the subject and/or see a portrait of the modern Spanish mind.

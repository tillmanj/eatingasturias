  abstract = {Background Heritage food has gained attention and recognition by locals as a cultural identity and by tourists as a new food experience. Two important intrinsic quality attributes of heritage food encompass safety and authenticity. As heritage food dishes are prepared in foodservice establishment, it entails requirements on ensuring safety and authenticity of heritage food. Scope and approach The study aims to conceptualise heritage food and identify risk factors that may compromise safety and authenticity. A semi-structured literature review was conducted to explain the heritage dimensions and to evaluate multiple food concepts relating to heritage to define the heritage food concept. Furthermore, risk factors were inferred from the literature that could compromise the safety and authenticity of heritage food. Key findings and conclusions Three main heritage dimensions identified from literature are legacy, people and place. Based on the evaluation against the three heritage dimensions, traditional food was mostly linked to the legacy and place dimensions. Ethnic food was typically related to the dimensions people and legacy, whereas for local food the dimension place was most dominant. Literature showed that all dimensions seem to be relevant for heritage food, but the number of definitions available in the literature is still limited. Therefore, it is not yet clear if all dimensions are equally important. Furthermore, a framework was developed with the identified authenticity risk factors, which originated from literature about ethnic, local and traditional food. The identified safety risk factors are common in the foodservice sector. The framework needs to be further validated through studies with stakeholders in heritage food production.},

  abstract = {The increasing interest in heritage food by tourists requires a deeper understanding of its concept. A previous study conceptualised heritage food into three dimensions (i.e. legacy, people and place) and developed a framework describing the main activities in heritage food production, the connection to the identified dimensions and potential authenticity risk factors. This study aims to validate the heritage food concept and the identified authenticity risk factors in the production of heritage food dishes. Semi-structured interviews with culinary professionals of foodservice establishments in Saudi Arabia and Italy were conducted to validate the concept and evaluate the risk factors based on their professional expertise. Data were analysed by thematic content analysis using MAXQDA to infer categories describing the heritage food concept. The results indicated that the previously determined heritage food dimensions were confirmed by professionals. The identified categories `inheritance' and `authenticity of the recipe and cooking' corresponded with legacy, whereas the category `locality of ingredients' linked to place. The category `knowledgeable chefs representing their culture' is related to people. Another category `heritage food is subject to cultural and societal influences' emerged which demonstrates that authenticity is not static but evolves. Most culinary chefs from both countries confirmed the earlier identified authenticity risk factors. Moreover, three new authenticity risk factors arose from the interviews including `adaptation to customer preference', `costs of ingredients', and `non-native origin of chef'. Further research is necessary to investigate how these risk factors differ among various types of foodservice establishments.},

Due to the age of the buildings and their state of neglect, many of them require rehabilitation proceedings. However, there is not any criterion to carry out these actions.

  abstract = {This book looks at the textual attempts to construct a national cuisine made in Spain at the turn of the last century. At the same time that attempts to unify the country were being made in law and narrated in fiction, Mariano Pardo de Figueroa (1828-1918) and Jos{\'e} Castro y Serrano (1829-96), Angel Muro Goiri (1839 - 1897), Emilia Pardo Baz{\'a}n (1851-1921) and Dionisio P{\'e}rez (1872-1935) all tried to find ways of bringing Spaniards together through a common language about food. In line with this nationalist goal, all of the texts examined in this book contain strategies and rhetoric typical of nineteenth-century nation-building projects. The nationalist agenda of these culinary texts comes as little surprise when we consider the importance of nation building to Spanish cultural and political life at the time of their publication. At this time Spaniards were forced to confront many questions relating to their national identity, such as the state's lackluster nationalizing policies, the loss of empire, national degeneration and regeneration and their country's cultural dependence on France. In their discussions about how to nationalize Spanish food, all of the authors under consideration here tap into these wider political and cultural issues about what it meant to be Spanish at this time.

  abstract = {Unravelling the debate about the Spanish nation and its identity in the new democracy, this book looks at the issue as both a historical debate and a contemporary political problem, particularly complex due to the legacy of the Francoist Dictatorship which deeply eroded the legitimacy of Spanish nationalism. During and since the transition Spanish nationalist discourse has evolved to meet the challenge of new concepts of nation and identity. These formulations arguevery different configurations of the relationship between nation and state. While the Constitution of 1978 defines Spain as a nation of nationalities, many politicians and intellectuals now claim that Spain is a nation of nations, others that it is a nation of nations and regions, or apost-traditional nation state, or post-national state. For the peripheral nationalists, it is merely a state of nations and regions. What is at issue is not whether Spain exists or not as a nation; rather, it is the traditional ways of seeing Spain from both the centre and the periphery that are being challenged.The Reinvention of Spain examines the ways in which Spanish and regional identities are projected and how influence the external actions of the Spanish state. It also analyses the dynamic of comparative grievance and competition between regions deriving from the peculiar architecture of the state in Spain, and their effect on social and political cohesion. Finally, it examines scenarios of change that might foster solutions but asserts that Spain will continue to reinventitself.},

  abstract = {This paper compares and contrasts commercial and academic perspectives on the nature of authenticity and the role it plays within the hospitality, tourism and leisure industries. The discussion commences by looking at the complex nature of the relationship between food and ourselves as consumers and then goes on to examine how society seeks to regulate the authenticity of food by using terms such as organic, protected and local. The paper examines some of the perspectives on object reality and a move to subsume the wide range of thought on this subject under a single, but very broad understanding, developed by Heidegger. The author challenges this view and concludes that our perceptions of authenticity involve an interaction between what we are considering (the thing), society (the others) and the individual that is contemplating this whole idea of authenticity (the self), particularly with reference to food.},

  abstract = {A book without precedent, skirting the line between recipe-book, memoir, history and philosophy, Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin's The Physiology of Taste is edited with an introduction by Anne Drayton in Penguin Classics. Brillat-Savarin's unique, exuberant collection of dishes, experiences, reflections, history and philosophy raised gastronomy to an art form. First published in France in 1825, this remarkable book reflected a new era in French cuisine: the advent of the restaurant, which gave the bourgeoisie the opportunity to select their dishes with precision and anticipation. Yet the author also gives his views on taste, diet and maintaining a healthy weight, on digestion, sleep, dreams and being a gourmand. Witty, shrewd and anecdotal, The Physiology of Taste not only contains some remarkable recipes, it an elegant argument for the pleasures of good food and a hearty appetite. Anne Drayton's lively translation is accompanied by an introduction illustrating the remarkable nature of this work, by a man who was not a chef or an author but a magistrate in a French provincial town. Jean-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (1755-1825) was born in Belley, France, an area renowned for its food and wine. After graduating in law, Brillat-Savarin became magistrate of Belley and was later elected Mayor. During the French Revolution his life was endangered and he fled to other parts of Europe and then America, earning his living as a violinist in a theatre orchestra. He returned to France in 1796 and became a judge of the Supreme Courts of Appeal. He began compiling a book of meditations on gastronomy and in 1825, a few months before his death, published this brilliant treatise on the pleasures of eating: the culmination of a life-long love affair with food.},

  abstract = {The key to becoming a successful artisan cheesemaker is to develop the intuition essential for problem solving and developing unique styles of cheeses. There are an increasing number of books on the market about making cheese, but none approaches the intricacies of cheesemaking science alongside considerations for preparing each type of cheese variety in as much detail as Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking. Indeed, this book fills a big hole in the market. Beginner guides leave you wanting more content and explanation of process, while recipe-based cookbooks often fail to dig deeper into the science, and therefore don't allow for a truly intuitive cheesemaker to develop. Acclaimed cheesemaker Gianaclis Caldwell has written the book she wishes existed when she was starting out. Every serious home-scale artisan cheesemaker-even those just beginning to experiment-will want this book as their bible to take them from their first quick mozzarella to a French mimolette, and ultimately to designing their own unique cheeses. This comprehensive and user-friendly guide thoroughly explains the art and science that allow milk to be transformed into epicurean masterpieces. Caldwell offers a deep look at the history, science, culture, and art of making artisan cheese on a small scale, and includes detailed information on equipment and setting up a home-scale operation. A large part of the book includes extensive process-based recipes dictating not only the hard numbers, but also the concepts behind each style of cheese and everything you want to know about affinage (aging) and using oils, brushes, waxes, infusions, and other creative aging and flavoring techniques. Also included are beautiful photographs, profiles of other cheesemakers, and in-depth appendices for quick reference in the preparation and aging room. Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking will also prove an invaluable resource for those with, or thinking of starting, a small-scale creamery. Let Gianaclis Caldwell be your mentor, guide, and cheering section as you follow the pathway to a mastery of cheesemaking. For the avid home hobbyist to the serious commercial artisan, Mastering Artisan Cheesemaking is an irreplaceable resource.},

  abstract = {Three basic assumptions, common in the literature on tourism, regarding ``commoditization'', ``staged authenticity'', and the inability of tourists to have authentic experiences are re-examined. Authenticity is conceived as a negotiable rather than primitive concept, the rigor of its definition by subjects depending on the mode of their aspired touristic experience. New cultural developments may also acquire the patina of authenticity over time --- a process designated at ``emergent authenticity''. It is also argued that commoditization does not necessarily destroy the meaning of cultural products, although it may change it or add new meanings to old ones. Conclusions contrary to the deductions following from the above assumptions are spelled out, and a new approach to the study of authenticity and meaning in tourism, which could help the formulation of a more discerning tourism policy, is advocated. R{\'e}sum{\'e} L'authenticit{\'e} et la marchandisation du tourisme. On examine dans cet article trois suppositions de base qui se trouvent souvent dans les oeuvres de recherche sur le tourisme au sujet de la ``marchandisation'', la ``mise-en-sc{\`e}ne de l'authenticit{\'e}'' et l'incapacit{\'e} des touristes d'{\'e}prouver des exp{\'e}riences authentiques. L'authenticit{\'e} se pr{\'e}sente comme un concept n{\'e}gotiable plut{\^o}t qu'un concept primitif. La rigueur de la d{\'e}finition de l'authenticit{\'e} d{\'e}pend de la nature de l'exp{\'e}rience touristique {\`a} laquelle on aspire. Les nouveaut{\'e}s culturelles peuvent en plus acqu{\'e}rir un air d'authenticit{\'e} avec le temps, ce qu'on peut appeler ``l'authenticit{\'e}{\'e}mergente''. On soutient aussi que la marchandisation ne d{\'e}truit pas n{\'e}cessairement le sens des produits culturels, bien qu'elle puisse changer ce sens ou ajouter de nouveaux sens aux anciens. On explique bien clairement des conclusions qui sont contraires {\`a} la d{\'e}ductions qui s'ensuit de ces suppositions, et on pr{\^o}ne une nouvelle fa{\c c}on d'aborder l'{\'e}tude de l'authenticit{\'e} et du sens dans le tourisme, ce qui pourrait mener {\`a} la formulation d'une politique touristique plus perspicace.},

El proyecto expositivo, en el que junto al comisario gestionado y coordinado por el Mus{\'e}u del Pueblu d'Asturies, el Museo Casa Natal de Jovellanos y el Departamento de Museos de la FMCEyUP, es un ejemplo m{\'a}s de la labor de investigaci{\'o}n y difusi{\'o}n que los museos municipales de Gij{\'o}n/Xix{\'o}n vienen desarrollando desde hace d{\'e}cadas para estudiar y divulgar aspectos poco tratados de la cultura material e inmaterial de Asturias que tienen una especial incidencia en el concejo de Gij{\'o}n/Xix{\'o}n. Esta labor de estudio y difusi{\'o}n permite contextualizar y poner en valor las ricas colecciones que se custodian en la red municipal de museos, tarea para la que es imprescindible el programa de adquisici{\'o}n y recuperaci{\'o}n patrimonial que vienen desarrollando los museos gijoneses, y que en esta ocasi{\'o}n ha permitido reunir y documentar un n{\'u}mero considerable de materiales relacionados con la cultura y producci{\'o}n de la sidra. Las m{\'a}s de 700 piezas expuestas, procedentes en su mayor parte de las colecciones del Mus{\'e}u del Pueblu d'Asturies, a las que se suman prestamos de otras instituciones p{\'u}blicas y colecciones privadas, ofrecen la oportunidad no s{\'o}lo de conocer una parte de la historia de la producci{\'o}n sidrera asturiana sino tambi{\'e}n de ahondar en la vinculaci{\'o}n de la creaci{\'o}n art{\'i}stica y las artes gr{\'a}ficas en el contexto social, cultural y econ{\'o}mico de la Asturias de la {\'e}poca. Una muestra que, tal y como se{\~n}ala el autor del proyecto, es clave para publicitar y prestigiar el relato de la sidra, al tiempo que propicia el desarrollo de una conciencia social de la necesidad de preservar este importante patrimonio cultural.

The contributors consider Spanish cuisine as presented in a variety of texts, including literature, medical and dietary prescriptions, historical documents, cookbooks, and periodicals. They draw on literary texts in their socio-historical context in order to explore concerns related to the production and consumption of food for reasons of hunger, sustenance, health, and even gluttony. Structured into three distinct "courses" that focus on the history of foodstuffs, food etiquette, and culinary fashion, The Gastronomical Arts in Spain brings together the many sights and sounds of the Spanish kitchen throughout the centuries.},

  abstract = {Cider production is a traditional industry in Northern Spain and it needs specific cultivars to produce a high quality beverage. Six cultivars selected in Asturias (Spain) for cider production, 'Blanquina', 'Cristalina', 'Marialena', 'Reineta Encarnada', 'Raxao' and 'Te{\'o}rica', have been tested to determine their performance during eleven years on two rootstocks, MM.106 and MM.111. Full bloom was quite late with all cultivars, from 28 April to 20 May, which could be of interest in areas with late frost. The harvest time of 'Marialena' was particularly early, and could be inconvenient for the cider industry. MM.106 and MM.111 showed similar vigor in our conditions, but MM.106 induced a higher productivity with some cultivars. With both rootstocks, 4 x 3.5 m was an insufficient planting distance for all cultivars except 'Cristalina' which could be planted closer. All cultivars began to fruit the fourth year except 'Blanquina' and 'Cristalina', which fruited the fifth and sixth year, respectively. The most productive cultivar during the first two years was 'Marialena'. All cultivars exhibited biennial bearing except 'Cristalina'. Considering total production after ten years, two groups could be estabilished: i) cvs. Blanquina, Marialena and Raxao, with more than 200 kg/tree, and ii) cvs. Cristalina, Reineta Encarnada and Te{\'o}rica, with less than 170 kg/tree. The most vigorous cultivars were 'Marialena' and 'Raxao'. 'Blanquina', Te{\'o}rica' and 'Marialena' had high productivity and are recommended using MM.106 rootstock in our conditions. 'Raxao' is also quite interesting though it should be grafted on a dwarf rootstock such as M.9. 'Cristalina' should be rejected because it is non-precocious with low productivity, and likewise 'Reineta Encarnada' which was the least productive cultivar tested.},

Why are some so pleasing while others are not? Delicious is a supremely entertaining foray into the heart of such questions.With generous helpings of warmth and wit, Rob Dunn and Monica Sanchez offer bold new perspectives on why food is enjoyable and how the pursuit of delicious flavors has guided the course of human history. They consider the role that flavor may have played in the invention of the first tools, the extinction of giant mammals, the evolution of the world's most delicious and fatty fruits, the creation of beer, and our own sociality. Along the way, you will learn about the taste receptors you didn't even know you had, the best way to ferment a mastodon, the relationship between Paleolithic art and cheese, and much more.Blending irresistible storytelling with the latest science, Delicious is a deep history of flavor that will transform the way you think about human evolution and the gustatory pleasures of the foods we eat.},

These understandings repose in the sense of the appropriate relationship between building structures and family structures, between the desire to gather "under one roof" and the impulse toward separation of individual conjugal units.},

This paper has been conceived to disseminate Asturian paremiology, with in a Hispanic and European cultural frame, and aims both to become a local reference for further comparative studies (on the basis of some classification criteria commonly accepted), and to show to non-Asturian readers some internal keys required for their comprehensive understanding. This edition starts with a study of the problems of written transmission of Asturian paremiae, and the specific sociolinguistic parameters of the spoken language of the community concerned in a given social context. It also includes a wide range of proverb variants, the anthropological explanation to the different citation and literature reference useful for scholars and specialized readers.},

  abstract = {Why do certain easily preventable diseases persist in the modern world? Renate Lellep Fernandez sheds light on this paradox by investigating the high incidence of iodine deficiency disease (IDD) among mountain villagers in northern Spain. Just as the mystery of non-prevention leads the author far beyond the confines of a single place, so are the experiences of these villagers rich in lessons for biocultural anthropology and public health in many contexts. The symptoms of iodine deficiency include not only the disfiguring goiters associated with the disease but also a catalog of more serious and even fatal complications. The burden of caring for victims of IDD has taxed the resources of this Spanish village beyond reason. Yet even though its people were---and are---eager for good health and quick to take advantage of modern medical treatment, which has long been available, until very recently they failed to learn that iodized salt prevents the disease. A Simple Matter of Salt unveils the social and political obstacles that have impeded the successful dissemination of preventive knowledge. Here are valuable implications for the prevention of other endemic diseases on a global scale. This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact. Drawing on a backlist dating to 1893, Voices Revived makes high-quality, peer-reviewed scholarship accessible once again using print-on-demand technology.

  abstract = {The thirty-five handbook chapters confront four major themes in the politics of food: property, technology, justice and knowledge. Ronald Herring's editorial introduction asks how food is political, highlighting contention around the role of market, state and information in societal decisions. The first section of the handbook then examines technology, science and knowledge in food production. What is known - and disputed - about malnutrition, poverty and food security? The second section addresses ethics, rights and distributive justice: agrarian reform, gender inequality, entitlements and subsidies, and the social vision of the alternative food movement. The third section looks to intersections of agriculture and nature: wild foods, livestock, agro-ecological approaches to sustainability, and climate change and genetic engineering. The fourth section addresses food values and culture: political consumerism, labeling and certification, the science and cultural politics of food safety, values driving regulation of genetically modified foods and potential coexistence of GMOs, and organic and conventional crops. The fifth and final section looks at frontiers of global contentions: rival transnational advocacy networks, social movements for organic farming, the who and why of international land grabbing, junctures of cosmopolitan and local food narratives, the "supermarket revolution" and the international agrifood industry in low-income countries, and politics of knowledge in agricultural futures.--INSIDE FLAP},

From quick and satisfying ricotta and panir to higher payoff cheeses like triple creme camembert, tallegio, and blue gouda--all of the featured cheeses can be made with readily available milks and common kitchen equipment. While most other cheese books take a homey approach to cheese making, this comprehensive, four-color tome embraces the full range of contemporary artisan-style cheeses and is destined to become a modern classic. Written by an experienced cooking teacher and filled with cheese-making tips from some of today's most influential cheese makers, Artisan Cheese Making at Home proves that hand-crafting cheese is not only easy, but also a fascinating and rewarding process"-- "A contemporary guide to making 100 artisan cheeses at home, with an extensive primer on ingredients, equipment, and techniques"--Provided by publisher.},

  abstract = {"Behind every traditional type of cheese there is a fascinating story. By examining the role of the cheesemaker throughout world history and by understanding a few basic principles of cheese science and technology, we can see how different cheeses have been shaped by and tailored to their surrounding environment, as well as defined by their social and cultural context. Cheese and Culture endeavors to advance our appreciation of cheese origins by viewing human history through the eyes of a cheese scientist. There is also a larger story to be told, a grand narrative that binds all cheeses together into a single history that started with the discovery of cheese making and that is still unfolding to this day. This book reconstructs that 9000-year story based on the often fragmentary information that we have available. Cheese and Culture embarks on a journey that begins in the Neolithic Age and winds its way through the ensuing centuries to the present. This tour through cheese history intersects with some of the pivotal periods in human prehistory and ancient, classical, medieval, renaissance, and modern history that have shaped western civilization, for these periods also shaped the lives of cheesemakers and the diverse cheeses that they developed. The book offers a useful lens through which to view our twenty-first century attitudes toward cheese that we have inherited from our past, and our attitudes about the food system more broadly. This refreshingly original book will appeal to anyone who loves history, food, and especially good cheese"--},

  abstract = {Here the author tells the remarkable story of the rise and fall of the world's great cuisines from the mastery of grain cooking some twenty thousand years ago, to the present. Probing beneath the apparent confusion of dozens of cuisines to reveal the underlying simplicity of the culinary family tree, she shows how periodic seismic shifts in 'culinary philosophy', beliefs about health, the economy, politics, society and the gods, prompted the construction of new cuisines, a handful of which, chosen as the cuisines of empires, came to dominate the globe. This book shows how merchants, missionaries, and the military took cuisines over mountains, oceans, deserts, and across political frontiers. The author's innovative narrative treats cuisine, like language, clothing, or architecture, as something constructed by humans. By emphasizing how cooking turns farm products into food and by taking the globe rather than the nation as the stage, she challenges the agrarian, romantic, and nationalistic myths that underlie the contemporary food movement.--Provided by publisher.},

The latter have been studied in terms of nutrition qualities, potential for achieving sustainable development and benefits for local communities; customer perceptions have also been in the spotlight. There has been, however no evidence yet of how the tourism businesses perceive traditional foods and of the most important aspects of this specific product. The purpose of this study is to assess the perception of traditional food and the importance they lay on its main characteristics. location of the study: The study was conducted among 34 hotel and restaurant managers in South western Bulgaria using an on-line questionnaire sent to a total number of 120 hotels with restaurants at this location. results and implication: The most important characteristics of " traditional food " perceived by respondents are popularity within a certain region, authentic way of cooking, relatively long and real history of consumption and production. Persistent high quality, safety, healthiness and good taste are the qualities that restaurateurs are trying to provide. There is also evidence of tourism businesses not been aware of the importance of using ecologically clean local produce. Conclusion: Despite the small scale of this study on traditional foods and the way they are perceived by managers in tourism, results are informative and relevant to those in many European countries and could be used for implementation in the tourist business.},

Even during the worst years of the centuries immediately following the fall of Rome, the legacy of that civilization survived. This book covers diet, cooking, housing, building, clothing, hygiene, games and other pastimes, fighting and healing in medieval times. The reader will find numerous misperceptions corrected. The book also includes a comprehensive bibliography and a listing of collections of medieval art and artifacts and related sites across the United States and Canada so that readers in North America can see for themselves some of the matters discussed in the book.},

In American Cider, experts Dan Pucci and Craig Cavallo give a new wave of consumers the tools to taste, talk about, and choose their ciders, along with stories of the many local heroes saving heirloom apples and producing new varieties. Like wine made from well-known grapes, ciders differ based on the apples they're made from and where those apples were grown. Combining the tasting tools of wine and beer, the authors illuminate the possibilities of this light, flavorful, naturally gluten-free beverage. And cider is more than just its taste--it's also historical, as the nation's first popular alcoholic beverage, made from apples brought across the Atlantic from England. Pucci and Cavallo use a region-by-region approach to illuminate how ciders and the apples they're made from came to be, from the well-known tale of Johnny Appleseed--which isn't quite what we thought--to the more surprising effects of industrial progress and government policy. American Cider is a guide to drinking, but even more so, it is a guide to being part of a community of consumers, farmers, and fermenters making the nation's oldest beverage its newest must-try drink"--},

  abstract = {There is a general assumption in the study of folk taxonomy that those people who have been interacting with a given crop the longest have the most knowledge about the crop's names. We treated this as an hypothesis which can be tested with knowledge of cider apples. This use of apples extends back many generations in some places, while in other regions people are just learning to make cider. The experimental design is to assess quantitatively the cider apple diversity being used compared to the knowledge of this diversity by cider makers. The test involves two populations of cider makers: those who come from a long-standing tradition of cider making and those who recently learned to make cider. Research was conducted in parts of England, Wales, Northern Ireland, and Washington State, U.S.A. Semistructured interviews and questionnaires were used to elicit cider apple variety names. Traditional knowledge associated with cider production was also collected. Eightytwo cider apple variety names were obtained. In addition, it is estimated that between 111 and 328 varieties were recognized but could not be named. There was a significant difference between the cider apple cultivars that cider makers could name and those that they could discern. On average, cider makers could name eight varieties, but discern 16 varieties of cider apples largely on the basis of appearance, taste, and smell. There was no significant difference in the knowledge of cider apple variety names between long-standing cider makers and those that recently learned to make cider. As with cider apples, we would expect that farmers of other culturally-significant crops would not always know named diversity if there are other cues to let them track varietal difference, such as appearance, taste, or smell.},

Nil Santi{\'a}{\~n}ez contends that fascism expressed its views on the state, the nation, and the society in spatial terms (for example, the state as a ``building,'' the nation as an ``organic unity,'' and society as the ``people's community''), just as its adherents celebrated fascism in its architecture, public spectacles, and military rituals. While Topographies of Fascism centres on Spain, a nation that produced a large number of fascist texts focused on space, it also draws on works written by key German, Italian, and French fascist politicians and intellectuals. Ultimately, it provides an innovative model for analyzing the comparable yet often overlooked strategies of symbolic representation and production of space in fascist political and cultural discourse."--},

  abstract = {Food and drink have provided fascinating insights into cultural patterns in consumer societies. There is an intimate relationship between food and identity but processes of identity formation through food are far from clear. This book adds a new perspective to the existing body of scholarship by addressing pivotal questions: is food central or marginal to identity construction? Does food equally matter for all group(ing)s? Why would, in peoples experience, food become especially important at one moment, or, on the contrary, lose its significance?The origin of food habits is also interrogated. Contributors investigate how, when, why and by whom cooking, eating and drinking were used as a means of distinction. Leading historians and sociologists look at concepts of authenticity, adjustment, invention and import, as well as food signs and codes, and why they have been accepted or rejected. They examine a wide range of periods and topics: the elderly, alcohol and identity in Early Modern Europe; food riots and national identity; noble families, eating and drinking in eighteenth-century Spain; consumption and the working class in the nineteenth century; commensality; the meaning of Champagne in Belle-Epoque France; the narrative of food in Norway; wine and bread in French Algeria; food and identity in post-war Germany.This intriguing book brings together new, comparative insights and research that allow a better understanding of processes of integration and segregation, the role of food in the construction of identity, and the relationship between old and new food habits.},

This book is a celebration of the great dishes, techniques and above all brilliant cooks who have, over the centuries, created the culinary landscape we now enjoy ... As well as shining a light on food's glorious past, there are contributions from a glittering array of stars of British cuisine, including Marco Pierre White, Delia Smith, Heston Blumenthal, Nigella Lawson and Jamie Oliver. In an incisive and humorous narrative, Sitwell enters an Egyptian tomb to reveal the earliest recipe for bread and discovers the greatest party planner of the Middle Ages. He uncovers the extraordinary and poetic roots of the roast dinner and tells the heart-rending story of the forgotten genius who invented the pressure cooker. And much, much more"--Publisher's description.},

Madrid-based journalist and 20-year resident Tremlett embarked on a journey around the country and through its history to discover why its people have kept silent so long, and here unveils the tinderbox of disagreements that mark the country today. Delving into such questions as who caused the Civil War, why Basque terrorists kill, why Catalans hate Madrid, and whether the Islamist bombers who killed 190 people in 2004 dreamed of a return to Spain's Moorish past, Tremlett finds the ghosts of the past everywhere. He also offers trenchant observations on Spanish life today, such as why Spaniards dislike authority figures, but are cowed by a doctor's white coat, and how women have embraced feminism without men noticing.},

Tools shape what we eat, but they have also transformed how we consume, and how we think about, our food. In Consider the Fork, award-winning food writer Bee Wilson provides a wonderful and witty tour of the evolution of cooking around the world, revealing the hidden history of everyday objects we often take for granted. Technology in the kitchen does not just mean the Pacojets and sous-vide of the modernist kitchen, but also the humbler tools of everyday cooking and eating: a wooden spoon and a skillet, chopsticks and forks. Blending history, science, and anthropology, Wilson reveals how our culinary tools and tricks came to be, and how their influence has shaped modern food culture. The story of how we have tamed fire and ice and wielded whisks, spoons, and graters, all for the sake of putting food in our mouths, Consider the Fork is truly a book to savor."--Back cover.},

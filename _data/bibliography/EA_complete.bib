Isidore compiled the work between c.615 and the early 630s and it takes the form of an encyclopedia, arranged by subject matter. It contains much lore of the late classical world beginning with the Seven Liberal Arts, including Rhetoric, and touches on thousands of topics ranging from the names of God, the terminology of the Law, the technologies of fabrics, ships and agriculture to the names of cities and rivers, the theatrical arts, and cooking utensils. Isidore provides etymologies for most of the terms he explains, finding in the causes of words the underlying key to their meaning. This book offers a highly readable translation of the twenty books of the Etymologies, one of the most widely known texts for a thousand years from Isidore's time.},

It does so assuming that the modernisation process of Spain's gastronomy transpired during these years, which is the same period recognised for when modernity emerged in other areas. This approach has been possible due to the discovery and analysis of unpublished testimonies of that time, mainly obtained from the general illustrated and specialised trade press as well as treatises written by cooks and writers of the period and the contemporary literature on the subject. These findings support the existence of factors such as the desire to have a national culinary identity, the creation of the first training centres, the emergence of professional associations and the abundant production of cookery books, treatises and culinary magazines. All these elements enable us to outline and contemplate the formation of the modern structure of gastronomic activity, but above all, they enrich part of its history and highlight the advisability of conducting research in a field that is so important for Spain; namely gastronomy.},

At the same time that attempts to unify the country were being made in law and narrated in fiction, Mariano Pardo de Figueroa (1828-1918) and Jos{\'e} Castro y Serrano (1829-96), Angel Muro Goiri (1839 - 1897), Emilia Pardo Baz{\'a}n (1851-1921) and Dionisio P{\'e}rez (1872-1935) all tried to find ways of bringing Spaniards together through a common language about food. In line with this nationalist goal, all of the texts examined in this book contain strategies and rhetoric typical of nineteenth-century nation-building projects. The nationalist agenda of these culinary texts comes as little surprise when we consider the importance of nation building to Spanish cultural and political life at the time of their publication. At this time Spaniards were forced to confront many questions relating to their national identity, such as the state's lackluster nationalizing policies, the loss of empire, national degeneration and regeneration and their country's cultural dependence on France. In their discussions about how to nationalize Spanish food, all of the authors under consideration here tap into these wider political and cultural issues about what it meant to be Spanish at this time.

  abstract = {Penning their gastronomic texts at the same time that the Spanish nation was being written into existence in laws, literature and history (see Labanyi 1--28), Spain's pioneering gastronomes debated the question of their nation's culinary identity. As this article discusses, one of the outcomes of this exchange was the inclusion of la olla podrida (the ``rotten pot'') at the royal table. Indeed, when Dr. Thebussem made his unorthodox suggestion to the King's Chef that la olla podrida be served at official court banquets as Spain's national dish, he not only influenced the dining habits of the country's elite but also introduced the importance of regional cuisines to Spanish culinary identity. Such was (and is) the strength of regional bonds in Spain that Dr. Thebussem realized any discussion about a national cuisine or dish would need to take into account the diversity of Spain's regional foodscapes, and thus from the outset his vision of Spanish cuisine contrasted with the dominant assimilationist French model of nationalism. In choosing a national dish that promoted both national unity and regional diversity, Dr. Thebussem highlighted the importance of not reducing Spain's multiple cuisines to a single, homogenized repertoire. This article argues that the ``recipe'' offered up for Spanish culinary nationalization, therefore, is unique, offering unity in diversity. The persistence of this approach, I argue, emphasises the continued aptness of this model in the context of a country that is regionally diverse, and celebrated for being so.},

These include the initial academic marginalisation of food studies itself, the slow acceptance of culinary texts as an object of academic study, as well as the ongoing drive to move food studies from the margins of Hispanic cultural studies. By reference to the Author's own research on Spanish culinary nationalism, this article also shows how the tension between centre and periphery is key to understanding Spanish food discourses of the past few centuries. This discussion hopes to show that the academy is increasingly paying attention to peripheral cultures and objects of study.},

  abstract = {"At least 200,000 people died from hunger or malnutrition-related diseases in Spain during the 1940s. This book provides a political explanation for the famine and brings together a broad range of academics based in Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia to achieve this. Topics include the political causes of the famine, the physical and social consequences, the ways Spaniards tried to survive, the regime's reluctance to accept international relief, the politics of cooking at a time of famine, and the memory of the famine. The volume challenges the silence and misrepresentation that still surround the famine. It reveals the reality of how people perished in Spain because the Francoist authorities instituted a policy of food self-sufficiency (or autarky): a system of price regulation which placed restrictions on transport as well as food sales. The contributors trace the massive decline in food production which followed, the hoarding which took place on an enormous scale and the vast and deeply iniquitous black market that subsequently flourished at a time when salaries plunged to 50\% below their levels in 1936: all contributing factors in the large-scale atrocity explored fully here for the first time"},

Ce num{\'e}ro de In~Situ. Revue des patrimoines questionne ainsi de multiples mani{\`e}res, pluridisciplinaires et compl{\'e}mentaires, la notion m{\^e}me de <<~patrimoines gastronomiques~>> et la fa{\c c}on dont ceux-ci sont, depuis pr{\`e}s de cinquante~ans maintenant, identifi{\'e}s, constitu{\'e}s, {\'e}tudi{\'e}s, conserv{\'e}s, prot{\'e}g{\'e}s, valoris{\'e}s et transmis. Les sp{\'e}cialistes du patrimoine, dans leur quotidien professionnel, se sont adapt{\'e}s {\`a} l'essor sans pr{\'e}c{\'e}dent de la recherche appliqu{\'e}e au domaine de la gastronomie. En explorant les relations entre nourriture et patrimoine et ph{\'e}nom{\`e}nes de patrimonialisation, les sciences du patrimoine ont profit{\'e} de l'implication renouvel{\'e}e des chercheurs et fait de la gastronomie un objet d'{\'e}tude total, qui ne peut plus exclure aujourd'hui l'ampleur des {\'e}tudes et des recherches men{\'e}es par les professionnels des services patrimoniaux eux-m{\^e}mes. De l'objet au monument, la gastronomie, dans son acception patrimoniale, se rattache {\`a} un large {\'e}ventail d'espaces sp{\'e}cialis{\'e}s~: jardins, potagers et vergers, conservatoires de plantes alimentaires et horticoles, restaurants, caf{\'e}s, usines de production alimentaire, commerces de produits de bouche, cuisines, salles {\`a} manger, salles des f{\^e}tes, lieux de restauration collective{\dots}, la typologie des lieux associ{\'e}s, {\`a} divers titres, {\`a} la notion, est l'une des plus riches qui soit. Dans leurs sp{\'e}cialit{\'e}s respectives, les acteurs du patrimoine ont progressivement d{\'e}frich{\'e} le champ des pratiques culinaires, {\`a} travers l'instauration et la valorisation de jardins patrimonialis{\'e}s et de conservatoires de plantes alimentaires, les {\'e}tudes du patrimoine gastronomique conduites par les services de l'Inventaire g{\'e}n{\'e}ral du patrimoine culturel, les chantiers de restauration ou de r{\'e}habilitation du cadre architectural de la gastronomie, les protections au titre des monuments historiques des lieux, des monuments et des objets mobiliers li{\'e}s aux arts culinaires, la collecte de fonds sp{\'e}cialis{\'e}s, dits parfois <<~fonds gourmands~>>, par les archives et les biblioth{\`e}ques et la constitution de collections d'objets par les mus{\'e}es, en particulier les {\'e}comus{\'e}es et les mus{\'e}es de soci{\'e}t{\'e}. Le patrimoine culturel immat{\'e}riel, qui met en valeur les pratiques, les savoirs et les savoir-faire des d{\'e}tenteurs de traditions vivantes, constitue l'av{\`e}nement patrimonial le plus r{\'e}cent du champ culinaire. Ainsi, bien avant l'inscription du repas gastronomique des Fran{\c c}ais par l'Unesco, et m{\^e}me d{\`e}s les ann{\'e}es~1960 selon les secteurs, les professionnels du patrimoine se sont pench{\'e}s sur le terrain tout mat{\'e}riel de la culture alimentaire et culinaire~: cet int{\'e}r{\^e}t pour l'infinie vari{\'e}t{\'e} des {\'e}l{\'e}ments mat{\'e}riels de la culture alimentaire et du fait culinaire s'est d{\'e}velopp{\'e} sur tout le territoire fran{\c c}ais, hexagonal et ultramarin, {\`a} travers autant de d{\'e}marches d{\'e}cisives pour identifier, {\'e}tudier, pr{\'e}server et valoriser ce patrimoine, tant{\^o}t b{\^a}ti, tant{\^o}t mobilier, tant{\^o}t {\'e}crit, tant{\^o}t anthropologique. L'observation sur le temps long et la prise en compte synoptique des principaux secteurs institutionnels que propose ce num{\'e}ro de In~Situ.

The dictatorship would lay the blame on external factors, although the causes for the collapse of living conditions and food supply over that time lay in its autarkic policies. This article attempts to show that Spain was victim of a famine as a consequence of the economic policies of the Franco dictatorship. To analyse the Spanish case, we rely on the conceptual framework of famine studies throughout history. We will demonstrate that Spain suffered an extreme socio-economic crisis during the 1940s, but that it was not until late 1939 and 1942, as well as 1946, that a true famine took place. In order to characterise and explain it, we will analyse three different aspects: the rise in the cost of living, the spread of infectious diseases and death by starvation.},

  abstract = {Discovered in County Antrim and Cambridgeshire respectively, the Dunaverney and Little Thetford flesh-hooks are two of only thirty-six currently known examples from the Bronze Age of the Atlantic seaboard of Europe. Both are impressive and enigmatic objects and are among the most elaborate of later-series flesh-hooks dating to c 1100--800 BC. Not surprisingly, from the time it was found in 1829, Dunaverney was the subject of much antiquarian interest. Yet, despite their rarity and unusualness, the Dunaverney and Little Thetford flesh-hooks have never been adequately studied.             Our investigations have provided an understanding of the technology of these two fleshhooks, as well as new chronological information for the type as a whole. They have also revealed new uses of lost-wax casting in the British Isles, where the use of this technique is otherwise rare. The bird motifs on the Dunaverney flesh-hook remain unique, although it is now possible to set them against a broader background of iconographic representations on Atlantic feasting gear. Moreover, certain recurring design features may suggest that iconographic symbols were originally more often present on flesh-hooks. The findspot of Dunaverney lies at the heart of deposits of other contemporary prestige metalwork and that of Little Thetford within the greatest concentration of finds of the innovative Wilburton-stage metalworking tradition; both re-enforce the social significance of these rare objects.},

His speeches, works on jurisprudence and the art of war, his precepts to his son on various subjects, and his great historical work on Rome and Italy are lost. But we have his De Agricultura; terse, severely wise, grimly humorous, it gives rules in various aspects of a farmer's economy, including even medical and cooking recipes, and reveals interesting details of domestic life.Varro (M. Terentius), 116-27 BCE, of Reate, renowned for his vast learning, was an antiquarian, historian, philologist, student of science, agriculturist, and poet. He was a republican who was reconciled to Julius Caesar and was marked out by him to supervise an intended national library. Of Varro's more than seventy works involving hundreds of volumes we have only one on agriculture and country affairs (Rerum Rusticarum) and part of his work on the Latin language (De Lingua Latina; Loeb nos. 333, 334), though we know much about his Satires. Each of the three books on country affairs begins with an effective mise en scene and uses dialogue. The first book deals with agriculture and farm management, the second with sheep and oxen, the third with poultry and the keeping of other animals large and small, including bees and fishponds. There are lively interludes and a graphic background of political events.},

These regions produce wonderful raw ingredients, which the home cooks of Spain have long used to create classic dishes like Romesco and Alioli, and modern-day chefs have rediscovered in order to bring Spanish food to the forefront of the gourmet world. All the dishes here are designed for cooking in your own kitchen and ingredients are carefully explained. The Food of Northern Spain discovers how the Spanish eat and their passion for good food; what the store cupboard basics are and the best Spanish wines to accompany different dishes; and~how to channel them into over 150 recipes. Every recipe stays faithful to the Spanish version and has introductory text that illuminates the history of the dish, when the Spanish might eat it, and different versions or useful tips. With wonderful photos taken by Jean Cazals, this title is both an insight into the cuisine of the area and a unique cookery book.},

  abstract = {Migration to the cities had been a part of European rural life long before the start of modern industrialisation and urbanisation. In the era of modern development, however, rural-urban migration intensified in an unprecedented way and many rural communities depopulated. While during the pre-industrial period migration had contributed to the economic and social reproduction of rural communities, it now challenged the continuity of the rural lifestyle. This book analyses the topic for the case of Spain, which in the twentieth century experienced one of the most intense processes of rural depopulation in modern Europe. The interaction between Spanish industrialisation and rural migration, the demographic implications of agrarian change, the obstacles to the development of rural non-farm activities, the rural problems of access to infrastructures and services, the role of public policy, and the consequences of depopulation for the rural community are the central elements of this study, which inserts the Spanish case within its European context. Distanced from both the anti-modern stance that idealises paradise lost and the Panglossian mood that welcomes anything that came with modernisation, the book explains how the adaptive strategies put into practice by rural populations led to a ``peaceful surrender'' of traditional rural society.},

This creative explosion has occurred in a productive dialogue with global currents and with considerable projection beyond the geopolitical boundaries of the nation and the state, but these seismic changes are only beginning to be the subject of attention of cultural and media studies. This book examines contemporary audio/visual production in Galicia as privileged channels through which modern Galician cultural identities have been imagined, constructed and consumed, both at home and abroad. The cultural redefinition of Galicia in the global age is explored through different media texts (popular music, cinema, video) which cross established boundaries and deterritorialise new border zones where tradition and modernity dissolve, generating creative tensions between the urban and the rural, the local and the global, the real and the imagined. The book aims for the deperipheralization and deterritorialization of the Galician cultural map by overcoming long-established hegemonic exclusions, whether based on language, discipline, genre, gender, origins, or territorial demarcation, while aiming to disjoint the center/periphery dichotomy that has relegated Galician culture to the margins. In essence, it is an attempt to resituate Galicia and Galician studies out of the periphery and open them to the world.},

Throughout the 1960s, glossy images of high-rise hotels, crowded beaches, and blondes in bikinis flooded public space in Spain as the Franco regime showcased its success. In Destination Dictatorship, Justin Crumbaugh argues that the spectacle of the tourist boom took on a sociopolitical life of its own, allowing the Franco regime to change in radical and profound ways, to symbolize those changes in a self-serving way, and to mobilize new reactionary social logics that might square with the structural and cultural transformations that came with economic liberalization. Crumbaugh's illuminating analysis of the representation of tourism in Spanish commercial cinema, newsreels, political essays, and other cultural products overturns dominant assumptions about both the local impact of tourism development and the Franco regime's final years.Justin Crumbaugh is Assistant Professor of Spanish at Mount Holyoke College.},

This book covers both these cutting-edge technologies and regeneration pathways, protoplast culture, in vitro mutagenesis, ploidy manipulation techniques that have been applied to a wider range of species. Three crop species, Diospyros kaki (persimmon), Punica granatum (pomegranate) and Eriobotrya japonica (loquat) are included for the first time. The chapters are organized by plant family to make it easier to make comparisons and exploitation of work with related species. Each chapter discusses the plant family and the related wild species for 38 crop species, and has colour illustrations. It is essential for scientists and post graduate students who are engaged in the improvement of fruit, nut and plantation crops.},

I analyze (1) the ways in which food production, distribution, and consumption can demarcate and sustain the emotive power of national attachment and (2) how nationalist sentiments, in turn, can shape the production and marketing of food. The multi-methodological analyses reveal how the construct of gastronationalism can help us better understand pan-national tensions in symbolic boundary politics---politics that protect certain foods and industries as representative of national cultural traditions. I first analyze the macro-level dimensions of market protections by examining the European Union's program for origin-designation labels that delineates particular foods as nationally owned. The micro-level, empirical case---the politics surrounding foie gras in France---demonstrates how gastronationalism functions as a protectionist mechanism within lived experience. Foie gras is an especially relevant case because other parties within the pan-national system consider it morally objectionable. Contemporary food politics, beyond the insights it affords into symbolic boundary politics, speaks to several arenas of sociological interest, including markets, identity politics, authenticity and culture, and the complexities of globalization.},

  abstract = {A savoury account of how the pursuit of delicious foods shaped human evolution Nature, it has been said, invites us to eat by appetite and rewards by flavour. But what exactly are flavours? Why are some so pleasing while others are not? Delicious is a supremely entertaining foray into the heart of such questions With generous helpings of warmth and wit, Rob Dunn and Monica Sanchez offer bold new perspectives on why food is enjoyable and how the pursuit of delicious flavours has guided the course of human history. They consider the role that flavour may have played in the invention of the first tools, the extinction of giant mammals, the evolution of the world's most delicious and fatty fruits, the creation of beer, and our own sociality. Along the way, you will learn about the taste receptors you didn't even know you had, the best way to ferment a mastodon, the relationship between Paleolithic art and cheese, and much more. Blending irresistible storytelling with the latest science, Delicious is a deep history of flavour that will transform the way you think about human evolution and the gustatory pleasures of the foods we eat. 'Our hosts at this empirical dinner party envision a new future for the study of flavour, with seats for the curious of every stripe...A persuasive, entertaining argument about how our avid pursuit of deliciousness helped shape our evolutionary path.' -- Kirkus Reviews 'A revolutionary look at the way our appetite for the delicious made us human. Taking readers on an exciting journey into the past, Dunn and Sanchez reveal how and why we love to eat the things we do and the impact this has had on human biology and culture. You will never look at food the same way again.' -- Vanessa Woods, New York Times bestselling author of Survival of the Friendliest},

  abstract = {The Story of Cornis a unique compendium, drawing upon history and mythology, science and art, anecdote and image, personal narrative and epic to tell the extraordinary story of the grain that built the New World. Corn transformed the way the entire world eats, providing a hardy, inexpensive alternative to rice or wheat and cheap fodder for livestock and finding its way into everything from explosives to embalming fluid. Betty Fussell has given us a true American saga, interweaving the histories of the indigenous peoples who first cultivated the grain and the European conquerors who appropriated and propagated it around the globe. She explores corn's roles as food, fetish, crop, and commodity to those who have planted, consumed, worshiped, processed, and profited from it for seven centuries. Now available only from the University of New Mexico Press,The Story of Corn,is the winner of a Julia Child Cookbook Award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals.  "Written in a lively and nontechnical style."--Library Journal  "Fussell has clearly done a good deal of research and a lot of traveling--peering over a precipice at Machu Picchu, descending into a restored ceremonial kiva of the Anasazi people in New Mexico, visiting the sole surviving corn palace from the Midwest boosters--glory days of a century ago."--Kirkus Reviews},

Now, the world's most influential writer on beer explains the character and uses of each style. What are the most refreshing beers? Which beers are good before meals, or with food? Most important, what are the classic examples of each style? Jackson highlights his favorites, often pitting American microbrews against European classics. Some of his choices will surprise you ... and introduce you to new and outstanding beers. Jackson's verdicts are based on first-hand experience - decades of traveling, tasting, and meeting brewers. Many beers now universally acknowledged as classics were little-known brews when he first highlighted them in the 1970s and 1980s.},

  abstract = {Histories of ancient Rome have long emphasized the ways in which the empire assimilated the societies it conquered, bringing civilization to the supposed barbarians. Yet interpretations of this "Romanization" of Western Europe tend to erase local identities and traditions from the historical picture, leaving us with an incomplete understanding of the diverse cultures that flourished in the provinces far from Rome. The Sons of Remus recaptures the experiences, memories, and discourses of the societies that made up the variegated patchwork fabric of the western provinces of the Roman Empire. Focusing on Gaul and Spain, Andrew Johnston explores how the inhabitants of these provinces, though they willingly adopted certain Roman customs and recognized imperial authority, never became exclusively Roman. Their self-representations in literature, inscriptions, and visual art reflect identities rooted in a sense of belonging to indigenous communities. Provincials performed shifting roles for different audiences, rehearsing traditions at home while subverting Roman stereotypes of druids and rustics abroad. Deriving keen insights from ancient sources--travelers' records, myths and hero cults, timekeeping systems, genealogies, monuments--Johnston shows how the communities of Gaul and Spain balanced their local identities with their status as Roman subjects, as they preserved a cultural memory of their pre-Roman past and wove their own narratives into Roman mythology. The Romans saw themselves as the heirs of Romulus, the legendary founder of the eternal city; from the other brother, the provincials of the west received a complicated inheritance, which shaped the history of the sons of Remus.--},

At its best, cider is a pure, healthy beverage that reflects both the skill of the cider maker and the quality of the fruit that's used to make it. And with the growing interest in locally grown and artisan foods, many new cideries are springing up all over North America--often started up by passionate amateurs who want to take their craft cider to the next level as small-scale craft producers. To make the very best cider--whether for yourself, your family and friends, or for market--you first need a deep understanding of the processes involved, and the art and science behind them. Fortunately, The New Cider Maker's Handbook is here to help. Author Claude Jolicoeur is a well-known and award-winning amateur cider maker with an inquiring, scientific mind. His book combines the best of traditional knowledge and techniques with the best modern practices to provide today's enthusiasts all they need to produce high-quality ciders. From deep, comprehensive information on all aspects of fermentation to advice on the best apples to grow or source for cider to instructions on how to build your own grater mill or cider press, the author's experience and enthusiasm shine through. Novices will appreciate the overview of the cider-making process that's presented in Part I. But as they develop their skills and confidence, the more in-depth and technical parts of the book will serve as an invaluable reference that will be consulted again and again"--},

  abstract = {Larousse Gastronomique has been the foremost resource of culinary knowledge since its initial publication in 1938. Long revered for its encyclopedic entries on everything from cooking techniques, ingredients, and recipes to equipment, food histories, and culinary biographies, it is the one book every professional chef and avid home cook must have on his or her kitchen shelf. In fact, Julia Child once wrote, "If I were allowed only one reference book in my library, Larousse Gastronomique would be it, without question." The culinary landscape has changed dramatically in the last decade, prompting a complete revision of this classic work. Larousse Gastronomique has now been updated to add the latest advancements that have forever changed the way we cook, including modern technological methods, such as sous-vide cooking and molecular gastronomy. All-new color ingredient-identification photographs give this edition a fresh, elegant look. And for the first time, Larousse features more than 400 reportage photos--candid images of upscale restaurants from around the world--that give behind-the-scenes access into the kitchens where the finest food is created. Dozens of new biographies of people who have made significant contributions to the food world debut in this revision, including such luminaries as Ferran Adri{\`a}, Daniel Boulud, Alice Waters, Gaston Len{\^o}tre, Thomas Keller, James Beard, and Julia Child. With entries arranged in encyclopedic fashion, Larousse Gastronomique is not only incredibly user-friendly, but it is also a fantastic read for anyone who loves food. Skip from Roasting to Robert (a classic French sauce), and then to Robiola (the Italian cheese); or go from Sake to Salad--with dozens of recipes--and on to Salamander, a type of oven used in professional kitchens for caramelizing (and named after the legendary fire-resistant animal). An index at the end of the book of all 3,800 recipes for cuisines from around the world makes it easy to find a myriad of preparations for any ingredient (eggs or chicken, for example) or type of dish (such as cakes or sauces). The unparalleled depth and breadth of information--from the traditional to the cutting-edge--make this newest edition of Larousse Gastronomique indispensable for every cook.},

  author = {Lassiter, Luke E.},
  year = {2005},
  month = sep,
  publisher = {University of Chicago Press},
  abstract = {Collaboration between ethnographers and subjects has long been a product of the close, intimate relationships that define ethnographic research. But increasingly, collaboration is no longer viewed as merely a consequence of fieldwork; instead collaboration now preconditions and shapes research design as well as its dissemination. As a result, ethnographic subjects are shifting from being informants to being consultants. The emergence of collaborative ethnography highlights this relationship between consultant and ethnographer, moving it to center stage as a calculated part not only of fieldwork but also of the writing process itself.  The Chicago Guide to Collaborative Ethnography presents a historical, theoretical, and practice-oriented road map for this shift from incidental collaboration to a more conscious and explicit collaborative strategy. Luke Eric Lassiter charts the history of collaborative ethnography from its earliest implementation to its contemporary emergence in fields such as feminism, humanistic anthropology, and critical ethnography. On this historical and theoretical base, Lassiter outlines concrete steps for achieving a more deliberate and overt collaborative practice throughout the processes of fieldwork and writing. As a participatory action situated in the ethical commitments between ethnographers and consultants and focused on the co-construction of texts, collaborative ethnography, argues Lassiter, is among the most powerful ways to press ethnographic fieldwork and writing into the service of an applied and public scholarship.  A comprehensive and highly accessible handbook for ethnographers of all stripes, The Chicago Guide to Collaborative Ethnography will become a fixture in the development of a critical practice of anthropology, invaluable to both undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty alike.},

  abstract = {What is meant by "Jewish Spain"? The term itself encompasses a series of historical contradictions. No single part of Spain has ever been entirely Jewish. Yet discourses about Jews informed debates on Spanish identity formation long after their 1492 expulsion. The Mediterranean world witnessed a renewed interest in Spanish-speaking Jews in the twentieth century, and it has grappled with shifting attitudes on what it meant to be Jewish and Spanish throughout the century. At the heart of this book are explorations of the contradictions that appear in different forms of cultural memory: literary texts, memoirs, oral histories, biographies, films, and heritage tourism packages. Tabea Alexa Linhard identifies depictions of the difficulties Jews faced in Spain and Northern Morocco in years past as integral to the survival strategies of Spanish Jews, who used them to make sense of the confusing and harrowing circumstances of the Spanish Civil War, the Francoist repression, and World War Two.  Jewish Spain takes its place among other works on Muslims, Christians, and Jews by providing a comprehensive analysis of Jewish culture and presence in twentieth-century Spain, reminding us that it is impossible to understand and articulate what Spain was, is, and will be without taking into account both "Muslim Spain" and "Jewish Spain."},

Diets were investigated through stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes from a sample of burials from eight cemetery sites (n\,=\,80). Social status was inferred by burial location, where individuals interred within church buildings (ad sanctos) were compared to those buried in cemeteries. While Medieval and Modern society was strongly hierarchical, burial location is only one factor in determining the status and diet of individuals. It was hypothesized that ad sanctos burials would have elevated {$\delta$}15N values as a reflection of high-status individuals consuming protein-rich diets in comparison to lower-status peasant populations; however, results found no significant differences in {$\delta$}15N values between those buried in ad sanctos compared to those buried in cemeteries. Rather, the results of our paleodietary reconstruction indicate that the difference in {$\delta$}13C values is statistically significant between burial location, where ad sanctos burials have more elevated {$\delta$}13C than commoner individuals. These elevated {$\delta$}13C values suggest that those buried in places of prestige often consumed a different diet (more C4 resources) from than those buried outside of church walls.},

Hailed by Time magazine as "a minor masterpiece" when it first appeared in 1984, On Food and Cooking is the bible to which food lovers and professional chefs worldwide turn for an understanding of where our foods come from, what exactly they're made of, and how cooking transforms them into something new and delicious. Now, for its twentieth anniversary, Harold McGee has prepared a new, fully revised and updated edition of On Food and Cooking. He has rewritten the text almost completely, expanded it by two-thirds, and commissioned more than 100 new illustrations. As compulsively readable and engaging as ever, the new On Food and Cooking provides countless eye-opening insights into food, its preparation, and its enjoyment. On Food and Cooking pioneered the translation of technical food science into cook-friendly kitchen science and helped give birth to the inventive culinary movement known as "molecular gastronomy." Though other books have now been written about kitchen science, On Food and Cooking remains unmatched in the accuracy, clarity, and thoroughness of its explanations, and the intriguing way in which it blends science with the historical evolution of foods and cooking techniques. On Food and Cooking is an invaluable and monumental compendium of basic information about ingredients, cooking methods, and the pleasures of eating. It will delight and fascinate anyone who has ever cooked, savored, or wondered about food.},

  abstract = {Esta obra aspira a ser una suerte de vadem{\'e}cum para los profesionales y aficionados a la gastronom{\'i}a en general, pero muy especialmente para los interesados en la asturiana en particular. El autor ha invertido a{\~n}os en investigar y sintetizar una buena parte de la documentaci{\'o}n de que dispone, pas{\'a}ndola, no obstante, por el filtro de una experiencia personal que ya supera los cuarenta a{\~n}os. Un esfuerzo que se ha materializado en la redacci{\'o}n de unas 3.200 voces o entradas y en torno a las 15.000 referencias contenidas en su conjunto, lo que bajo forma de diccionario brinda al lector una {\'u}til y pr{\'a}ctica herramienta ---pionera tanto a nivel nacional como internacional--- para acercarse de manera integral a una gastronom{\'i}a espec{\'i}fica, en este caso la asturiana. Un compendio, en definitiva, de lo m{\'a}s relevante del pasado y del presente en los fogones del Principado de Asturias y cuanto les rodea y complementa, desde las materias primas hasta la escritura coquinaria y la restauraci{\'o}n, pasando por las bebidas, los servicios de mesa, las industrias agroalimentarias o las empresas distribuidoras, entre muchas otras cosas.},

  abstract = {The Latin word ulpicum is attested thirty-one times. The literary texts in which the term occurs range in date from the second century B.C. to the seventh century A.D. It denotes a plant used in antiquity both as a foodstuff and as an officinal substance in human and animal prescriptions, but discussions of ulpicum in the work of classical scholars show that there is no agreement about its identity. This lack of clarity consequently obfuscates the understanding of the passages in which reference is made to the plant. Furthermore, those students of ancient medicine, botany, and horticulture who depend on translations receive an inaccurate and even misleading impression of the original Latin sources. I propose to demonstrate the present unsatisfactory state both of translations of the term and of efforts by classical scholars to identify the plant, then to review the data supplied by the ancient sources. Following this, I shall suggest that what Latin writers referred to as ulpicum is, in fact, the plant known to modern botanists as Allium ampeloprasum L., `great-headed garlic'. Finally, I shall investigate its function in the Roman diet and pharmacopeia.},

And despite the undeniably political character of that story, cultural history can also provide essential insights into the subject. Metaphors of Spain brings together leading historians to examine Spanish nationalism through its diverse and complementary cultural artifacts, from 'formal' representations such as the flag to music, bullfighting, and other more diffuse examples. Together they describe not a Spanish national 'essence,' but a nationalism that is constantly evolving and accommodates multiple interpretations"--Provided by publisher},

  abstract = {Landraces have the potential to provide a reservoir of genetic diversity for crop improvement to combat the genetic erosion of the food supply. A landrace collection of the vitamin-rich specialty crop collard (Brassica oleracea L. var. viridis) was genetically characterized to assess its potential for improving the diverse crop varieties of B. oleracea. We used the Illumina 60K Brassica SNP BeadChip array with 52,157 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to (i) clarify the relationship of collard to the most economically important B. oleracea crop types, (ii) evaluate genetic diversity and population structure of 75 collard landraces, and (iii) assess the potential of the collection for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) through characterization of genomic patterns of linkage disequilibrium. Confirming the collection as a valuable genetic resource, the collard landraces had twice the polymorphic markers (11,322 SNPs) and 10 times the variety-specific alleles (521 alleles) of the remaining crop types examined in this study. On average, linkage disequilibrium decayed to background levels within 600 kilobase (kb), allowing for sufficient coverage of the genome for GWAS using the physical positions of the 8273 SNPs polymorphic among the landraces. Although other relationships varied, the previous placement of collard with the cabbage family was confirmed through phylogenetic analysis and principal coordinates analysis (PCoA).},

  abstract = {During the first sequence of lockdowns implemented in many countries around the world in early 2020 as a result of the emerging COVID-19 pandemic, there was widespread concern amongst many health professionals regarding a predicted rise in alcohol consumption. However, studies have reported diverse findings, with some consumer groups exhibiting an increase and others a decrease in their alcohol purchase and consumption patterns. Although the long-lasting changes in alcohol consumption, if any, are still unknown, the current situation has effectively accelerated a number of pre-existing trends which will likely continue in the future. E-commerce is growing steadily, mainly because of the restrictions within the on-trade channel and concerns around catching COVID-19 amongst consumers, thus lifting traditional barriers to the adoption of digital channels. Premiumization has also grown significantly during the pandemic, especially in the spirits category, due, in part, to the fact that consumers have been increasingly trying to recreate bar and restaurant quality gastronomic experiences in the privacy of their own homes. The trend toward homemade experiences is multi-stakeholder as consumers, retailers, restaurateurs, bar owners, and brands all try to help facilitate at-home consumption experiences. Larger size purchases seem to reflect not only the stockpiling phenomena that occurred during the initial phases of the pandemic but also convenience for consumers (e.g., avoiding queues). Additionally, the growing home mixology movement has been observed to result in consumers buying larger amounts of alcohol in order to facilitate cocktail making experimentation at home. It is important to stress, though, that this review was specially focused on available data from the first three quarters of 2020, as an effort to identify and understand the first impacts the COVID-19 was creating amongst alcohol consumers. It currently remains uncertain how these trends will evolve, and whether or not they will continue post COVID-19 (whenever that might be). Key similarities and differences across national markets are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Food Heritage and Nationalism in Europe contends that food is a fundamental element of heritage, and a particularly important one in times of crisis. Arguing that food, taste, cuisine and gastronomy are crucial markers of identity that are inherently connected to constructions of place, tradition and the past, the book demonstrates how they play a role in intangible, as well as tangible, heritage. Featuring contributions from experts working across Europe and beyond, and adopting a strong historical and transnational perspective, the book examines the various ways in which food can be understood and used as heritage. Including explorations of imperial spaces, migrations and diasporas; the role of commercialisation processes, and institutional practices within political and cultural domains, this volume considers all aspects of this complex issue. Arguing that the various European cuisines are the result of exchanges, hybridities and complex historical processes, Porciani and the chapter authors offer up a new way of deconstructing banal nationalism and of moving away from the idea of static identities.   Suggesting a new and different approach to the idea of so-called national cuisines, Food Heritage and Nationalism in Europe will be a compelling read for academic audiences in museum and heritage studies, cultural and food studies, anthropology and history.

  abstract = {Como dec{\'i}a Jovellanos, el siglo XVIII espa{\~n}ol fue un siglo sembrado de <<semillas de luz>>, que con el correr del tiempo dar{\'i}an <<frutos de ilustraci{\'o}n y de verdad>>, que eran para el famoso ilustrado <<las prendas m{\'a}s ciertas de la felicidad del pueblo>>. <<El glorioso empe{\~n}o de ilustrar la naci{\'o}n para hacerla dichosa>>, en expresi{\'o}n tambi{\'e}n de Jovellanos, se manifest{\'o} a lo largo del siglo de mil modos y maneras, y no fue el menor empe{\~n}o lograr que los espa{\~n}oles tuvieran una mejor alimentaci{\'o}n. El progreso general, aunque no alcanz{\'o} a asegurar una buena mesa para todos, ofreci{\'o} a la mayor{\'i}a una mesa m{\'a}s abundante, m{\'a}s variada y de m{\'a}s calidad. Caracter{\'i}stico de la {\'e}poca fue el triunfo de productos antes ex{\'o}ticos como el tomate, el chocolate y el caf{\'e}, que se hicieron cotidianos, en tanto que otros comenzaron entonces a introducirse con dificultades, como la patata. Mientras la tradici{\'o}n culinaria espa{\~n}ola se mantuvo entre las clases populares, la alta gastronom{\'i}a cambi{\'o} radicalmente con la introducci{\'o}n de la cocina francesa. Desde la corte, pasando por las mesas de calidad de nobles y burgueses, hasta las mesas m{\'a}s sencillas de monjes y frailes, campesinos y artesanos, mendigos y viajeros, el panorama de la alimentaci{\'o}n espa{\~n}ola resulta muy complejo y diverso. Este libro, a partir de fuentes varias, recetarios de cocina, cuentas familiares, contratas de cocineros, literatura, reglas de {\'o}rdenes religiosas, relatos de viajeros, reconstruye desde diferentes perspectivas la alimentaci{\'o}n de los espa{\~n}oles del siglo xviii y trata de evocar los sabores, olores y colores de aquellas cocinas, mostrar las varias culturas de la mesa y el t{\'i}pico ambiente de los refrescos, los caf{\'e}s, los mesones y las posadas. Es, pues, un libro de historia y es un libro de cocina. Las muchas recetas de la {\'e}poca, incluidas para ayudar a comprender aquella cocina del pasado, dan al lector, adem{\'a}s, la oportunidad de colaborar en la evocaci{\'o}n del apasionante Siglo de las Luces, cocinando alguno de los sugestivos platos que se ofrecen. Se trata no solo de leer, sino tambi{\'e}n de saborear.

  abstract = {Bartolomeo Scappi (c. 1500-1577) was arguably the most famous chef of the Italian Renaissance. He oversaw the preparation of meals for several Cardinals and was such a master of his profession that he became the personal cook for two Popes. At the culmination of his prolific career he compiled the largest cookery treatise of the period to instruct an apprentice on the full craft of fine cuisine, its methods, ingredients, and recipes. Accompanying his book was a set of unique and precious engravings that show the ideal kitchen of his day, its operations and myriad utensils, and are exquisitely reproduced in this volume.Scappi's Opera presents more than one thousand recipes along with menus that comprise up to a hundred dishes, while also commenting on a cook's responsibilities. Scappi also included a fascinating account of a pope's funeral and the complex procedures for feeding the cardinals during the ensuing conclave. His recipes inherit medieval culinary customs, but also anticipate modern Italian cookery with a segment of 230 recipes for pastry of plain and flaky dough (torte, ciambelle, pastizzi, crostate) and pasta (tortellini, tagliatelli, struffoli, ravioli, pizza).Terence Scully presents the first English translation of the work. His aim is to make the recipes and the broad experience of this sophisticated papal cook accessible to a modern English audience interested in the culinary expertise and gastronomic refinement within the most civilized niche of Renaissance society.},

  abstract = {The significance of food and feasting to Pre-Columbian Mesoamerican cultures has been extensively studied by archaeologists, anthropologists and art historians. Foodways studies have been critical to our understanding of early agriculture, political economies, and the domestication and management of plants and animals. Scholars from diverse fields have explored the symbolic complexity of food and its preparation, as well as the social importance of feasting in contemporary and historical societies. This book unites these disciplinary perspectives --- from the social and biological sciences to art history and epigraphy --- creating a work comprehensive in scope, which reveals our increasing understanding of the various roles of foods and cuisines in Mesoamerican cultures. The volume is organized thematically into three sections. Part 1 gives an overview of food and feasting practices as well as ancient economies in Mesoamerica. Part 2 details ethnographic, epigraphic and isotopic evidence of these practices. Finally, Part 3 presents the metaphoric value of food in Mesoamerican symbolism, ritual, and mythology. The resulting volume provides a thorough, interdisciplinary resource for understanding, food, feasting, and cultural practices in Mesoamerica.},

Modern economic thought, Symons argues, is driven by a money-centric focus that benefits the interests of the 'corporate individual'-entities without finite appetites, motivated by an endless quest for financial growth-to the detriment of actual, corporeal individuals. Symons understands this shift as a modern devaluation of community and loss of a way of life that values food sharing, enjoyment and satiety. Covering a wide variety of thinkers-Jean Brillat-Savarin and Epicurus, Enlightenment philosophers Thomas Hobbes and John Locke, economic theorists Jean-Baptiste Say and Stanley Jevons, and neoliberals-Symons reads and critiques both popular and lesser-understood intellectuals to shed light into the 'economics of appetite' and the opposing 'economics of greed.' He calls for individuals to reject the self-interest of money pleasure and, through renewed attention to communal values of family, meal-sharing, food activism, and the defense of liberalism, advocates a return to a community-based philosophy of 'table pleasure.'"--},

In this unique memoir, culinary historian Michael W. Twitty takes readers to the white-hot center of this fight, tracing the roots of his own family and the charged politics surrounding the origins of soul food, barbecue, and all Southern cuisine. From the tobacco and rice farms of colonial times to plantation kitchens and backbreaking cotton fields, Twitty tells his family story through the foods that enabled his ancestors' survival across three centuries. He sifts through stories, recipes, genetic tests, and historical documents, and travels from Civil War battlefields in Virginia to synagogues in Alabama to Black-owned organic farms in Georgia. As he takes us through his ancestral culinary history, Twitty suggests that healing may come from embracing the discomfort of the Southern past. Along the way, he reveals a truth that is more than skin deep---the power that food has to bring the kin of the enslaved and their former slaveholders to the table, where they can discover the real America together.Illustrations by Stephen Crotts},

# Advertising Policy
Advertising on blogs is a thing that exists. Underhanded advertising practices on blogs are also a thing that exists. Some attempts have been made to rein in these underhanded types of advertisements:

- [The Committees of Advertising Practice (CAP)](http://www.cap.org.uk/News-reports/Media-Centre/2014/Remit-and-Social-Media.aspx#.U42MtfldVu4) say that bloggers should, ‘state explicitly if they have been paid to write content on behalf of an advertiser.’
- [The FTC has very strict rules](https://ftc.gov/opa/2009/10/endortest.shtm) on disclosing what you receive from brands, sponsors or advertisers in the form of cash or any other type of compensation.

Let me go further and state that Eating Asturias does not accept any kind of remunerated advertisements:

- There are no paid for advertisements here.
- Likewise there are no sponsored posts.
- There are also no pay-to-play reviews or paid mentions anywhere on this site.

If I mention a product or company here, it is because I personally recommend it. I do so without prior compensation or consideration of any kind.

If, in the future, there are ads for any product other than my own, I will make it very obvious. I will limit them solely to display advertisements shown in obvious and conventional ways. You will never confuse them with editorial content.

# Comment Policy
Comments are welcome on many of the posts and recipes on this site. Well-behaved commentors are a joy to interact with, and make all of our online interactions richer and more rewarding. Additional information, constructive criticism, and personal anecdotes are tons of fun to read, and are one of the reasons I started this blog.

Obnoxious, mean-spirited, rude, or overtly political comments are not welcome, and will not be approved by me. I see this site as an extension of my life, like my home, and all of you as my invited guests. I expect my guests to behave with a minimum of decorum, and have no problem escorting the disruptive ones outside.

So, be nice to each other. Be nice to me. Enjoy your time here and speak to others and you’d like to be spoken to. 

# Product Review Policy
I am not a sponsored post blogger. I will not talk about your product because you gave me a free one. That is, unless you are Nikon. I will totally write half a dozen whore posts for a new Z9.

I do occasionally write about or even recommend a product on this site. I do so because I genuinely think the item is cool, worthwhile, neat-o, and I own and enjoy one.

You are welcome to send me free things, but I am not going to write about them because you do. Unless you are Nikon. If you are Nikon, please send free things. I will totally write about them. 

# Recipe Attribution Policy
Inspired by the [excellent write-up](https://www.davidlebovitz.com/recipe-attribution/) by David Lebovitz, here is my general policy on reusing recipes that I publish here. If you are new to publication reuse I highly suggest you look at his article. It’s very informative.

The recipes that feature on this website are my work, based on my research, my cooking, my photography, and my writing. They represent the majority of the effort that I put into this website, and I would appreciate it if you would respect that.

If you want to reproduce one of my recipes as-is, without rewriting the whole thing in your own words and your own voice, then please consider simply linking to it on my website. If linking to the recipe does not fit your needs or desires, then by all means reproduce the recipe on your site and give me proper credit. “Proper credit” means you include a prominent link to the recipe on my website. In any case, do not republish any of my recipe (or other) photography on your site.

If you put effort into making the recipe yourself, give it some tweaks, and publish it on your site, I would very much appreciate if you provide a link to my recipe and title or subtitle the recipe “adapted from Jon Tillman’s recipe” or “adapted from Eating Asturias” or something else similar in wording and intent.

If you change the recipe a lot, please link as above but change the wording to something along the lines of “inspired by…”. 
# Restaurant Review Policy

> Caution to Innkeepers and others.—The Editor of the Hand-books has learned from various quarters that a person or persons have of late been extorting money from innkeepers, tradespeople, artists, and others, on the Continent, under pretext of procuring recommendations and favourable notices of them and their establishments in the Hand-books for Travellers. The Editor, therefore, thinks proper to warn all whom it may concern, that recommendation in the Hand-books are not to be obtained by purchase, and that the persons alluded to are not only unauthorised by him, but are totally unknown to him. All those, therefore, who put confidence in such promises may rest assured that they will be defrauded of their money without attaining their object.
> 
> — Richard Ford, _A Hand-book for Travellers in Spain and Readers at Home_, 1845

I do not visit the same place three times a year, taking furtive notes while I eat in disguise. Nor do I keep voluminous dossiers on restaurants, chefs, and rank them relative to each other.

I like to eat. I sometimes like to eat in restaurants; sometimes with other people, sometimes alone. A few of these experiences happen to simultaneously meet all the following criteria:

- They happen in a restaurant that could plausibly be called Asturian.
- I enjoyed the experience.
- I take a bunch of pictures.
- The chef, owners, and other patrons of the restaurant were nice enough to talk to me about it.
- I think you would like to hear about the experience, and would probably enjoy eating in the restaurant as well.

When all of those things happen to coincide, I write up my experience of the restaurant and post it here.
## Inclusion or Exclusion

If I have not written about a particular restaurant here, it could be for one of many reasons. Some of those reasons include:

- I have not been to the restaurant.
- The restaurant does not fit the style of the blog.
- I didn’t particularly enjoy my meal or visit there.

That means that you are not going to find negative reviews of restaurants here. You might find a negative thing said about a place as an aside in a story I post about something else. If you try hard enough, you might be able to suss out what exact restaurant I was talking about.

I also will not accept free meals or drinks in exchange for mentioning a restaurant. I only write about meals I have paid for without compensation of any kind.

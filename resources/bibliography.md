I try very hard to not make unsubstantiated claims or statements of unsupported fact on this website. Achieving that requires quite a bit of research, and I have amassed a sizable reference library in the course of assembling this website. Here, organized by theme, are the books, papers, proceedings, news articles, and other documents I have used in writing this website.

If you would like direct access to the bibliography files, they can be found at [Zotero Online](https://www.zotero.org/groups/2459245/eating_asturias/library).

Ok, so pote is a big deal in Asturias. A BIG deal. Think Texas State Fair BBQ and Chili Cook-Off big deal. Pote has the same level of competitive cooking to it here in Asturias. So of course, I have to throw my hat into the ring and offer up my very own Pote Americano.[1]

Briefly, pote is the Asturian and Galician equivalent to olla (as in olla podrida) in Castilla, and cocido in Madrid.[2] That means it is not a single dish, but a complex of dishes. It is a direct descendant of the pottage that comprised the majority of peasant and laborer cooking in the middle ages. Its closest American equivalent is “pork and beans”, and a southern variation on that dish is my starting point for this recipe.

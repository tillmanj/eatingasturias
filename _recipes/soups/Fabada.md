So beloved is fabada in Asturias that it is nearly impossible to find someone living here who does not eat it on a regular basis. Despite its relatively recent debut in Asturian gastronomy it is both the most loved dish in, and the most recognizable symbol of, Asturian cooking.[^2] If someone knows a single thing about Asturian food, it’s fabada. 

## Fabada History

Most of medieval Europe ate some version of a perpetual stew. That is exactly what it sounds like:

{% blockquote 'q01' '…an ever-changing broth enriched daily with whatever was available. The cauldron was rarely emptied out except in preparation for the meatless weeks of Lent, so that while a hare, hen or pigeon would give it a fine, meaty flavor, the taste of salted pork or cabbage would linger for days, even weeks.' 'Reay Tannahill' 'Food in History. Crown Trade Paperbacks, 1995' %}

In Spain this was the *olla podrida*, the forerunner of fabada.[^3] Descended from the Jewish adafina stew, it was popular across the Iberian peninsula.[^4] It was described by Cervantes, through the words of Sancho Panza:

{% blockquote 'q02' 'That great big steaming dish looks like olla podrida to me, and since that sort of hotchpotch stew has got so many different things in it, I can’t fail to come across one that I’ll like and will do me good.[^1]' 'Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra' 'El ingenioso caballero Don Quijote de la Mancha (Parte II, Cap. XLVII)' %}

## Modern Fabada

Sometime in the 16th century, the medieval olla podrida began to change in Asturias. People replaced the chickpeas typical of the stew with white runner beans. People were then planting many more runner beans as garden crops in Asturias. With this, the final connection to adafina was severed, and the dish became the fabada we recognize today. Once it had been a stew of chickpeas, chicken meat and eggs. Now it was now a dish of white beans and pork sausages.

To the south, in Castilla y León, as well as elsewhere, Chickpeas continued to reign supreme. Even as the singular olla podrida fragmented into as many cocidos as there are regions of Spain, the chickpeas remained. Not in Asturias though. Here, once the fabes entered the pot, there was no looking back.

Fortunately, this is a recipe that is easy to make all over the world. Read on for how to make an authentic fabada at home in the US, or elsewhere. (astute readers might be interested in comparing that most American of all soups, Senate Bean Soup[^5] to Fabada)

## Notes
[^1]: *Aquel platonazo que está más adelante vahando me parece que es olla podrida, que por la diversidad de cosas que en las tales ollas podridas hay, no podré dejar de topar con alguna que me sea de gusto y de provecho*
[^2]: The first reference to Fabada as a restaurant dish is from 1884 in the _El Comercio_ newspaper. See {% cite MendezRiestra2017DiccionarioCocinaGastronomia -l 258 %}
[^3]: from _[popurrí](https://dle.rae.es/?w=popurr%C3%AD)_ and the colloquial meaning of _[podrido](https://dle.rae.es/podrido)_: “having a lot of…”
[^4]: “_…in the days of the Inquisition, when every man’s Christianity had to be restated daily if he were to survive, it became customary in Spain to ensure that there was always either pork in the cauldron or the dried pork sausage called chorizo hanging from the rafters as a sure proof that no Jew or Muslim lived or ate in the house._” {% cite Tannahill1995FoodHistory -l 241 %}
[^5]: See [this interesting article](https://wamu.org/story/14/12/12/steeped_in_tradition_the_story_of_the_senates_signature_soup/) for a small history of, and the official recipe for, Senate Bean Soup, which to my eyes looks like Fabada with only ham.

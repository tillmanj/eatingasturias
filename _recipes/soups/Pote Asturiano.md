Pote is not one soup. It is hundreds of soups. That is, it is a style of soup making that does not have a fixed single recipe. Originally named for the pottage[1] common across all of medieval Europe, it is today defined as a particularly Asturian and Galician version of the Spanish type of pottage, known as olla podrida or simply olla.[2]

Today pote is more similar to the cassoulet of France than to the olla podrida of middle Spain.[3] This recipe makes use of a slow cooker. You can make it without one by soaking the beans overnight and assembling the remainder the next day.

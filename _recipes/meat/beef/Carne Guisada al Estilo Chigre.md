recipeIngredients:
  - 800g **Stew Beef**, cut into chunks
  - 1 large **White Onion**, diced
  - 200 ml *[sidra natural](/culture/products/cider/)*, or other still cider
  - 20 ml neutral **cooking oil**
  - "**sea salt**, to taste"
  - "**white pepper**, to taste"
  - "**smoked paprika**, to taste"
recipeInstructions:
  - Place the 800g of stew beef into a mixing bowl, add your salt, pepper, and paprika to taste, toss and set aside.
  - Put 20 ml of cooking oil in your dutch oven and heat over high heat until shimmering.
  - Once the oil is hot, add your beef to the dutch oven and stir until browned on all sides.
  - Reduce heat to medium-low, and add all remaining ingredients. Stir once or twice and cover.
  - Every 15-20 minutes, lift the lid and check on your progress. You want the onion and garlic to soften and disintegrate, not caramelize or burn. Lower the temperature a bit if you see this happening.
  - If the liquid evaporates before the stew is finished, add a bit more.
  - After an hour or so, the beef should be fork tender and the sauce almost gone. Remove from heat and allow to stand for 10-15 minutes before plating.

{% newthought 'The chigre is one of the cornerstones'%} of Asturian gastronomy. Or at least of Asturian drinking culture. Which may actually be the same thing. The longer I live here the more muddled the distinction between the two becomes. That muddle is not helped by “bars” that have excellent home-style food. Nor by “restaurants” that you go to solely to drink. 

An example of a recipe from the first type is this: *Carne guisada al estilo chigre* or Stewed beef, cider-bar style.

I originally came across this recipe in *Platos Tipicos de Asturias*. That is the seminal regional cookbook compiled by Maria Luisa Garcia in 1971. Since then I have sampled variations on it in a wide variety of locations. I have also cooked it a fair few times as well. There are a couple things to consider when making it. Let’s look at the ingredients one by one.

## To Veal or not to Veal

Asturias is wild for veal. Spain in general likes veal a lot more than America, but Asturias cranks it up to a fever pitch. I personally dislike for a variety of reasons. The chief objection I have is that it is mostly used terribly incorrectly. Absolutely never should veal be slow cooked, stewed, or cooked with strongly flavored ingredients of any kind. Veal is a very lean, delicately flavored meat. It requires the gentlest of touches in order to coax out the inherent flavors. That touch is impossible in a stew. Stews are for tough, flavorful, muscular cuts of meat. In my opinion, this stew is immeasurably improved by substituting proper cubed stew beef for the ternera.

## Spicy or Not Spicy

A number of recipes for this carne guisada contain a guindilla. Now given that the Spanish word guindilla is the generic for chili pepper, this isn’t much help.[^1] Not even the RAE Dictionary sheds any additional light on the subject. It calls it “a small very spicy pepper”.[^2] In most parts of Asturias, this usually means a dried cayenne pepper, but it varies.

That said, both ‘small’ and ‘spicy’ are incredibly subjective, particularly in a place where some brands of ketchup get sold next to imported hot sauces. I will, in good American fashion, take this to mean “use whatever pepper you prefer”. Add some red bell pepper diced up to give the dish color. Or toss in a Dragon Ball round peppers floating in its own oil. Trust yourself, an go with the spiciness level you enjoy.

## Notes
[^1]: See [this newspaper article](https://www.elespanol.com/ciencia/nutricion/20191222/guindilla-especia-debes-comerla-no-guste-picante/452455609_0.html) for an example of how ‘guindilla’, ‘chile’, and ‘pimiento’ are used interchangeably by most people
[^2]: See definition 2 in [this entry](https://dle.rae.es/guindilla). As to the first entry, the definition of “guindillo de Indias” is something akin to a Peppadew or Cascabel pepper. Not remotely close to what people mean when they say _guindilla_. Call that an interesting tidbit if you wanted to track down the **most** authentic ingredient possible.

  - For a commercial level of smoothness, pass the resulting puree through first a medium and then a fine chinois

recipeIngredients:
  - 1 kg apples
  - 700 g sugar
  - juice and zest of 1 lemon
  - 100 ml water
recipeInstructions:
  - Wash and core your apples, but do not peel them. We need all the pectin that the peels can provide to get this jelly to set right.
  - Cut the apples into chunks and put them in a large, heavy bottomed pot.
  - Add the juice and zest of one lemon and 100 ml of water.
  - Cook over medium low heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples are very soft; approximately 30 minutes.
  - Pass the apples through a blender (or use an immersion blender) to make a very fine puree. (see note 1)
  - Return them to the pot along with the 700 g of sugar, and lower the heat.
  - Cook gently, stirring very frequently to keep it from scorching, until a spoon stuck into the pot will stand up on its own (approximately 90 minutes)
  - Pour the apple mixture into glass or heavy plastic containers to let cool

{% newthought 'One of the great benefits' %} of living in Asturias is the abundance of apples in every hamlet, village, and town. And despite the vast majority of those apples going into [cider](/culture/products/cider/), there are plenty left for a plethora of apple-based recipes.

*Dulce de manzana* is one of several types of fruit pastes that have been made in the mediterranean basin for at least as long as we have cookbooks to prove such things.[^1] Unlike American-style fruit jellies, *dulce* is practically a solid, and is sliced, not spooned onto things.

I make this spread with a mix of whatever apples I collect from the older trees of unknown variety around my farm. You can make it at home with any apples you can buy at the store. For a more authentic flavor, use a tart apple like a Granny Smith.

I was immediately drawn to this dish when I first saw it in a cookbook in [[Asturias]]. It looks so much like the kind of food I grew up eating, so I knew it would be my sort of recipe. 

I am uncompromising when it comes to recipes involving stewed chicken. There are no shortcuts worth taking in recipes like this. Properly stewing a chicken takes time. First we make a stock and cook the chicken. We do these at the same time in a slow cooker, overnight. then we cool the chicken broth all day (or overnight) before skimming off the excess fat. Then we are ready to assemble the soup, which takes less than an hour once the prep is all done.

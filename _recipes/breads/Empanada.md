recipeIngredients:
  - 500 g All-Purpose Flour.
  - 5 g sweet paprika.
  - 20 g salt.
  - 150 ml olive oil.
  - 150 ml dry white wine or still cider.
  - 1 large egg
requires:
  - 
recipeInstructions:
  - In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, salt, egg, paprika, and cider or wine.
  - Using the paddle attachment, mix on slow until you get a nice shaggy dough that can't quite hold together.
  - Slowly drizzle the olive oil into the mixer until the whole mass comes together into a smooth homogeneous mass.
  - Stop the mixer and either switch to the dough hook or knead by hand. Either way, it will take about 15 minutes of mixing to develop all of the gluten in the dough.
  - Dump the dough into a bowl and let it rest at room temperature for 2-3 hours.
  - Begin preheating your oven to 200C.
  - Divide the dough in half, and return one half to the covered bowl.
  - On a lightly floured surface, roll out the other half of the dough, making a rectangle. This will take practice. I find it best to get to a rough rectangle and then trim and reassemble the pieces as needed. You are looking for a final rectangle roughly 12 × 16-inch (30 × 40-cm) in size.
  - Repeat the rolling process with the second half of the dough, but roll it out into a rectangles ever so slightly smaller than the first.
  - Place the larger rectangle of dough on a baking sheet and add your filling.
  - Gently lay the smaller dough sheet on top, and either fold the bottom edge over the top and crimp, or simply crimp them together with a fork. (You want to repulgar the edges of your empanada - close them in a way that doesn't allow any filling to leak out. The standard american way to do this is repulgado tenedor, sealing with a fork. In Asturias, we prefer a more decorative fold and twist style of closure. There is a great video demonstrating the technique, along with several other types of closure. Choose whichever one you prefer!)
  - Using a small circular cutter, or a sharp knife, cut a chimney in the center of the empanada to allow steam to escape. You can additionally poke it all over with a fork.
  - Brush the whole top of the empanada with the beaten egg, using roughly half of it.
  - Put it into the preheated oven and bake for ~30 Minutes.
  - Working quickly, brush the top again with the remaining egg, and return it to the oven for another 15 Minutes, or until it is a deep, glossy brown.
  - Let cool completely on a wire rack before serving.
recipeNotes:
  - This recipe makes one large Spanish style empanada, which is roughly the size of a medium pizza. Unlike the round Galician empanada, the Asturian one is most commonly found as a rectangle. That may have something to do with the popularity of empanada as an espicha nibble in Asturias. In that setting, being able to cut your empanada into nice squares for serving is paramount.
  - The filling should be cold when you put it on the dough. Don't add hot filling to your empanada unless you like soggy pastry that won't hold together.
  - Though my recipe calls for olive oil, you can use another type of oil if you prefer. Not only will a flavorless cooking oil be cheaper, it will allow the flavor of the filling ingredients to shine.
  - Once cooled, you can keep an empanada in the refrigerator for about a week.
  - If you refrigerate your empanada, make sure you remove it from the fridge several hours before eating it. Like most party food, it is designed to be eaten at room temperature.

While most popular, and popularly associated with, neighboring Galicia, the empanada is a well-loved part of Asturian gastronomy. They are as ubiquitous here as the tortilla de patatas is further south in Spain. While all of Spain likes a good empanada, it is really the northwest where they become a way of life.

The empanada dough recipes you find in the States are very different from what it is in Spain. Egg Yolks, butter, lard… these recipes sound like sweet pastries and have nothing to do with traditional Spanish empanada. A Spanish style dough is much closer to a Cornish Pasty than a North or South American version. It is also much larger. What we call an empanada in the US is an empanadilla in Spain.

At the bottom of this post is a standard recipe for a basic dough you can use to make Spanish style empanadas or emapanadillas. But first, let’s talk about what should go inside your empanada.

Every cuisine, the world over, has it's bedrock ingredients, it's foundational dishes, and it's iconic products. They define what the cuisine is, it's essential flavor profile. Elisabeth Rozen made a whole career out of explaining these pillars of various cuisines.[^1] In Asturias, the pillars that define the flavor of the region are apples, beans, cheese, and seafood.

I mention Rozin for two reasons. Firstly because she was an enormous influence on my own culinary career and how I have thought about food and food cultures since first encountering her work in the early 1990s. Secondly, because Asturias does not follow the flavor principle she outlines for Spain. {% cite Rozin1985EthnicCuisineFlavorPrinciple -l pp 111 %} While it is true that most of Spain hews close to her triumvirate of olive oil, garlic, and ground nuts, Asturias uses none of those three ingredients in any appreciable way. Here, the flavors take on a decidedly Atlantic character, looking more towards Brittany and the British Isles than to the Mediterranean.[^2]

Instead, here we look at the true pillars of Asturian cuisine as it exists today.

## Apples
Though it is difficult to point to a single pillar being more important than any other in Asturian cuisine, it is hard to argue that the apple is not the most iconic of the four. The apple is the foundation of the most famous product of Asturias, the cider.

## Notes
[^1]: The seminal work in her oeuvre is *Ethnic Cuisine* {% cite Rozin1985EthnicCuisineFlavorPrinciple %}, A huge number of chefs in the US require new cooks to read this book as part of their culinary education. In addition, the bookend volumes *The Flavor Principle Cookbook* and *Blue Corn and Chocolate* are also highly recommended reading.

Morcilla is composed of pig’s blood, onion, bacon, paprika, garlic and salt. Stuffed into natural casings and smoked with oak, this is rarely found by itself. There are morcillas blancas that do not use blood, particularly in the southwestern part of the country.

_Morcilla_ is a blood sausage, made in Asturias from pig’s blood, ground meat, onions, and paprika. Relatively easy to find, particularly if you live near a Mexican _carnicería_, as the Mexican _moronga_ is interchangeable. If not, I highly recommend the [DESPAÑA brand](https://despanabrandfoods.com/products/a-despana-morcilla). Both because it is immensely cheaper than places that mark up Spanish products 1000% and pretend it’s because of import fees, and because the recipe they use is a traditional Asturian one.

In most of Spain, and certainly in the more-famous Burgos variety of morcilla, rice is the binder. Not so in Asturias. In Asturias (and most of neighboring and once allied León) caramelized onions are the only acceptable binder.

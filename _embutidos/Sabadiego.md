Lean pork, bacon, blood, onion, paprika, salt, garlic and spices are the ingredients of sabadiego, another Noreña specialty. Usually simply pan fried it is also very popular for parrillada – grilling out. Primarily known in the central valley of Asturias, it is becoming more widely known thanks to the “Caballeros de la Orden del Sabadiego“, which promotes Noreña cuisine and sausage making. Chosco

I often joke that Asturians will make a sausage out of anything. If you needed any proof of that, you could look at chosco de Tineo. It’s a little difficult to call something that is 80% whole pork loin a sausage, but here in Asturias, no one seems to mind. Once you taste it, you won’t mind either.

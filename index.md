intro: 
  - excerpt: '*In Spain, perhaps more so than anywhere in Europe, the geography of the land has played a major role in the political. cultural, and culinary history of the people who lived on the land. It has certainly played a role in what those people put in their cooking pot.*<br />

    excerpt: "The Recipe Index contains my recipes, and my writing about those recipes. I provide both context and a trans-cultural perspective on each recipe I post. Like much regional American food, Asturian food is easy to cook, homey, and hearty. It’s basically perfect for home cooking, and the majority of Asturian restaurants pride themselves on being home-cooking types of places that serve exactly what people want to eat.

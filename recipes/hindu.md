These recipes are, to the best of my knowledge, safe for Hindus to eat. That is to say, these recipes do not contain:

- animal based foods
- mushrooms
- garlic
- onions
- alcohol

*I am not a dietician, and cannot certify that these recipes are safe for any particular person. I am providing pointers towards recipes that you might find fitting to your particular situation. As always, the final decisions for your health rest with you.*

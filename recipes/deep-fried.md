The earliest mention of deep frying that I have found is Archestratus (the world's first food critic) who described frying electric ray in oil in the 4th century BCE.{%sidenote 'sn-deep-fried-01' 'Albert Rapp. (1955). The Father of Western Gastronomy. The Classical Journal, 51(1), 43–48. doi:10.2307/3293756'%} Since that time, we have been enthusiastically dunking everything we could get our hands on into hot oil.

Condiments are things added to food after cooking to enhance or complement the flavors. It comes from the Latin *condimentum*, meaning "spice, seasoning, sauce".[^1] Sauces are things that are poured over food or food is dipped in. While similar, the yare definitely different. This is my collection of sauces and condiments (mostly sauces) that I use in Asturian cooking.

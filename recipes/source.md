Asturias has a number of notable cookbooks. Some are locally and nationally famous, like *El arte de cocinar*, and some are less known but deeply important from a historical perspective, such as *El libro de las Guisanderas de Asturias*. When I use a recipe from a particular cookbook with only minor changes, I tag it with the cookbook or other source it comes from. This is the index of those sources, with links to all the recipes that come from them.

Whether you call them variety meats, pluck, organ meats, or offal, the internal organs of animals are a big part of Asturian cuisine. Like most regional Spanish (and European) cuisines, *casquería* or *despojos* continue to be a significant part of the diet, long past the years when survival depended on using every bit of the animal. The most common offal in Asturias is lamb and mutton, but you can also find recipes for beef, pork, and chicken offal.

Marzipan is loved the world over, and Asturias is no slouch when it comes to holiday figurative marzipan. Turron is a Spanish holiday classic, and comes in a bewildering array of styles - seemingly more than there are regions in Spain to name them after. In Asturias with its tradition of home-cooking, especially for holidays, it is important to have a full repertoire of turron recipes.

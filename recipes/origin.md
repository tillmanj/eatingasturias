I am extremely interested in how recipes evolve through time and space. As food cultures rub up against each other they exchange recipes, techniques, and ingredients. When those recipes strike a chord in the new culture, they get adopted, and over time, changed -- made into a new localized version.

Asturias has quite a few recipes that originate in other food cultures. When the provenance is documented, I tag the recipe with its food culture of origin. Here are the various places Asturias has inherited recipes from.

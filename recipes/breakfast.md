While I make a big deal out of Asturian food being very different from the rest of Spain, one place in which they are very similar is breakfast. In Spain, breakfast is a simple affair, usually consisting of a cup of coffee and a pastry. In Asturias, it is the same, but with more homemade *biscocho*.

So the majority of the recipes I present here are based on American (and British) concepts of breakfast. My neighbors are much more likely to eat most of these things for a later supper.

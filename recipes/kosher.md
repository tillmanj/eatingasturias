These recipes are, to the best of my knowledge, kosher. That is to say, these recipes do not contain:

- land animals that do not have cloven hooves and chew their cud
- sea animals that do not have fins and scales
- birds of prey or scavenger birds
- animal blood in any form
- Suet (chelev) fat or sciatic nerve-containing meat
- dairy and meat in the same recipe

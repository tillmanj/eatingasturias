Some recipes are objectively more challenging than others. *Aglio e Olio* is simple enough to be a child's first recipe, while *Consomm√©* is a thing that even highly trained chefs must practice diligently to master. In order not to accidentally get you in in over your head, I tag each recipe on the site with one of three difficulty ratings: Easy, Medium (or normal), or Challenging. That way you can choose whether or not you'd like to be challenged by the recipe, or breeze through an easy one.

Asturias is definitely a dessert loving region. I have never seen so many pastry shops in such a small area. And the desserts are not just for special occasions. It is common to have a sweet treat with your coffee in the morning, or as a snack in the afternoon. Every large meal is finished with a dessert, and it is not uncommon to have a small dessert after a light meal.

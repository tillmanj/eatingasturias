Lamb is particularly popular in Asturias. This is to be expected in a place with an enormous dairy industry that loves making [three-milk cheeses](/culture/products/cheese/three-milk-cheeses/). (*see also [goat](/recipes/meat/goat/)*). There are also a few recipes here for mutton, which is less common but still eaten in the region.

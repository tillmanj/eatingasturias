I find it amazing that within a single century a large portion of the world forgot that food was a seasonal thing -- that not everything is (or even should be) available all year round. The amount of advice on the internet about how to eat with the seasons is a testament to how far we have come from the days when you ate what you could grow or preserve.

Asturias is a place that has always been very in tune with the seasons. The food that is eaten in the winter is very different from the food that is eaten in the summer. This is not just because of the weather, but because of the availability of ingredients. In the winter, you eat what you have stored from the summer. In the summer, you eat what you have grown. For more on seasonal eating in Asturias, see my article on [Seasonality](/recipes/seasonality/).

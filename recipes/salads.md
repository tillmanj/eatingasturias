Salads are somewhat underrepresented in Asturian cuisine, with many traditional cookbooks omitting them entirely. The most common salads are the *ensalada mixta* (mixed salad) and the *ensalada de tomate* (tomato salad). The *ensalada mixta* is a simple salad of lettuce, tomato, and onion, dressed with olive oil and vinegar. The *ensalada de tomate* is just tomato, onion, and olive oil.

There are however, a growing number of salads in common circulation, especially in restaurants these days. Here I have a mix of more traditional salads from venerable cookbooks, and some modern elaborations, either my own or contemporary chefs.

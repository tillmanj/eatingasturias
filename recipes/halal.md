These recipes are to the best of my knowledge halal. I have determined this by applying the heuristic “[Everything is halal except ABCD IS haram](https://halalfoundation.org/what-is-halal/)”. That is to say, these recipes do not contain:

- alcohol or any other type of intoxicant
- blood in any form
- the meat of carnivorous (or omnivorous just to be safe) animals
- bugs of any kind
- pork, swine, or any of their products.

*I am not a dietician, and cannot certify that these recipes are safe for any particular person. I am providing pointers towards recipes that you might find fitting to your particular situation. As always, the final decisions for your health rest with you.*

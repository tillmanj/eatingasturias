These recipes are, to the best of my knowledge, low-fat. That is to say, these recipes have been calculated to contain 3 g or less of fat per 100 g as prepared and not more than 30% of its calories from fat, as laid out in [EU Permitted Nutrition Claims](https://food.ec.europa.eu/food-safety/labelling-and-nutrition/nutrition-and-health-claims/nutrition-claims_en).

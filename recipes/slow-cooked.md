Many asturian recipes that were originally meant to be [simmered](/recipes/method/simmered/) can also be adapted to a modern electric slow-cooker. This is especially important now as most modern homes (in the US) do not have either a wood-buring cook-stove nor an outdoor kitchen for use in hotter months.

I am slowly rewriting a load of traditional Asturian recipes to fit the slower heat and longer cook times of the modern appliance, and sharing them here.

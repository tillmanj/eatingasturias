It is a bit incorrect to call pastries a dessert, because they are ever-present. They are a perfectly acceptable breakfast, the preferred mid-morning coffee treat, always acceptable for a snack anytime, and a popular dessert for a stand-up meal of any time. (see *[Espichas](/culture/espichas/)* for instance)

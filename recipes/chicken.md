Chickens are an ever-present feature of rural Asturias, running free in the villages and fields. These *pitus caleyas* are the semi-wild chickens that live in the village roads (*caleyas*) and fields. Larger and more flavorful than the battery-raised chickens you find in the supermarket, they are a real treat.

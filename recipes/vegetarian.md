These recipes are, as prepared, vegetarian. That is to say, these recipes do not contain any meat at all, from land or sea.

*I am not a dietician, and cannot certify that these recipes are safe for any particular person. I am providing pointers towards recipes that you might find fitting to your particular situation. As always, the final decisions for your health rest with you.*

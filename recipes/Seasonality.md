Asturian cuisine, like all traditional European cuisines that retain a strong connection to the land, is seasonal.[^2] Whether or not a particular person in Asturias grows a garden or not (and a shockingly large number do, even in the cities), they are likely to have strong opinion about what season or month a particular vegetable or fish is best to eat.[^1] These opinions are the traditional received wisdom that form the bedrock of the [food culture](/culture/).

However, Asturian food is not seasonal in the way that modern French food is. It does not revolve around picking and cooking vegetables at the height of their flavor (when still very small) and accompanying them with meat from animals that also eat them at that time. This is a legacy of privation and want. It is only recently (the second half of the 20th century) that starvation was not a serious concern for much of the Spanish populace.[^3]

When the main concern was making sure there are enough calories for most of the people in the house, there was little room in the garden or the field for mesclun mixes or permanent asparagus beds. Nutrient and calorie dense potatoes and beans were (and to a large extent still are) the order of the day. Cattle and pigs graze on land too steep or wooded to plant on, and their meats and cheeses contribute to the diet as well. But tiny baby beets, luxurious melons, and exotic eggplants were not part of the subsistence diet, and still have not made many inroads into the Asturian garden.

That is not to say that there are not seasonal recipes in Asturias. Apples are processed into cider and dulce de manzanas only in Autumn. [Frixuelos](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Frixuelos "Frixuelos") are eaten primarily during carnaval. [Fabada](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Fabada "Fabada") is the ultimate winter food, made from dried beans and long keeping pork sausages.

I mark recipes with the season or the holiday if they have a particular association with it. As Asturians get used to having fresh seasonal vegetables in every season, they too will add to the seasonality of the food here. There is a separate section for [seasonal recipes](/recipes/season/) that are particularly associated with a season and a section for [holiday recipes](/recipes/occasion/) that are associated with a specific occasion.

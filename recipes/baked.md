We have a long history of baking, with the oldest known bread ovens dating to 9,000 years ago in Syria. Throughout those millennia, baking has been a focus of communities. From ancient communal ovens to the modern urge to welcome new neighbors with a cake or loaf of bread, baked goods have always been shared.

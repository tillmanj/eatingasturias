*Helados* are well loved throughout Spain, but primarily consumed outside of the home. Ice cream and other frozen desserts are found everywhere, except at home, as the paucity of ice cream options in the supermarkets attests. I spend quite a bit of effort in finding those frozen treats that people **do** enjoy and make at home.

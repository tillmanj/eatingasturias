These recipes are, to the best of my knowledge, low-salt. That is to say, these recipes have been calculated to contain 120 mg or less of salt per 100 g as prepared, as laid out in [EU Permitted Nutrition Claims](https://food.ec.europa.eu/food-safety/labelling-and-nutrition/nutrition-and-health-claims/nutrition-claims_en).

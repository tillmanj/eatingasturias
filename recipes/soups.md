One-Pot cooking is the heart and soul of Asturian food. While the rest of Spain might serve a vegetable dish followed by a meat dish, Asturias tends to put everything together. To me, it is one of the best things about Asturian cooking.

In Spain, these dishes are called *platos de cuchara*, "spoon dishes", and they run the gamut from simple broths and boullions (*caldo*) to hearty stews (*estofados* and *guisos*).

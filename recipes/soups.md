One-Pot cooking is the heart and soul of Asturian food. While the rest of Spain might serve a vegetable dish followed by a meat dish, Asturias tends to put everything together. To me, it is one of the best things about Asturian cooking.

In Spain, these dishes are called *[platos de cuchara](/culture/primer/platos-de-cuhcara.html)*, "spoon dishes", and they run the gamut from simple broths and bouillons (*caldo*) to hearty stews (*estofados* and *guisos*).

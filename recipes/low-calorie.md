These recipes are, to the best of my knowledge, low-calorie. That is to say, these recipes have been calculated to contain 40 calories or less per 100 g as prepared, as laid out in [EU Permitted Nutrition Claims](https://food.ec.europa.eu/food-safety/labelling-and-nutrition/nutrition-and-health-claims/nutrition-claims_en).

*I am not a dietician, and cannot certify that these recipes are safe for any particular person. I am providing pointers towards recipes that you might find fitting to your particular situation. As always, the final decisions for your health rest with you.*

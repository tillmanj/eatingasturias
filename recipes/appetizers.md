Spanish snacking is a world unto itself. From Andalusia we get *tapas* which are tiny portions of other dishes, usually served with a drink. From the Basque Country we get *pintxos* which are are not tapas, but are individual tiny dishes that do not have a larger counterpart. Add to that the *aperitivos* and *picoteo* and you have a whole world of things to eat before you even approach the *entremeses*. Fortunately, you can just call them all *cosas para picar* (things for snacking on) and not try to remember which is which.

From dishes common at *espichas* to simple make-ahead empanadas and tortillas for picnics and cold lunches, these are the most popular appetizers in Asturias.

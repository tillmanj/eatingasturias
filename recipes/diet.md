When you have a restricted diet, whether it be for medical, ethical, or religious reasons, it can be hard to find recipes outside of websites that cater to only one diet. And while it's great that vegan recipe sites (for instance) exist, it's asking a lot of that site to survey all the regional cuisines of the world and present the recipes to you. 

So I am trying to do my part to tag recipes on the site that meet common dietary restrictions so you can find some great Asturian food that fits with your lifestyle.

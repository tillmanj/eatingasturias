I am combining pan frying and sautéing into one category for the simple reason that they describe the same cooking technique, applied to two different sizes of pieces of food. From a method of cooking sense, it doesn't matter if the thing is a pork chop or a diced scallion -- it's being cooked in a little bit of oil in a nice hot pan.

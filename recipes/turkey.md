King Ferdinand decreed in 1511 that every ship sailing back to Spain from the Americas must bring 10 turkeys, 5 male and 5 female. By 1530 that decree had created a formal turkey farming industry, and Spain was exporting the birds to Italy and France.

The turkey continues to be a popular meat in Asturias, and not just at autumn feasts.

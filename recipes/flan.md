If you know nothing else about Spanish desserts, you probably know *flan*, the caramel-covered baked custard loved throughout the country (and the rest of the Spanish speaking world). Of solidly French origin (even the word *flan* is French, and the original Spanish term for it is *crema volteada*), it was adopted enthusiastically in Spain, and has been a staple of Spanish dessert menus ever since.

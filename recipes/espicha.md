An *[espicha](/culture/espicha/)* is not a celebration with a particular spot on the calendar (anymore). It is a style of party, popular for many occasions, in which finger foods and [sidra natural](/culture/products/cider/) take center stage. There are certain dishes that pretty much always show up at these parties, and they can make an excellent addition to your party food repertoire.

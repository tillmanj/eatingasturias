{% epigraph 'Tradition, most of the time, doesn’t respect ingredients' 'Massimo Bottura' 'Chef‘s Table - [S1E1](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4383018/)' %}

{% newthought 'When the recipe follows the available ingredients' %}, then there is innovation and improvement. When the ingredients are chosen for flavor, grown with care, and cooked as soon as possible after harvest, then there is a real cuisine of place. When the ingredients are assembled from all of what is available in the world, the quality can be very high, but there is not a sense of place in the food.

Asturias has a more-or-less year-round growing season, and a mild enough climate to allow for a very wide variety of ingredients to be grown or otherwise produced within it's boundaries. I am just as interested in these as I am in the recipes cooked with them. This *materia prima* is what makes Asturian cuisine Asturian. It connects the food cooked in it's restaurants to the long tradition of what is cooked at home, and it grounds (quite literally) what is cooked at home to what can be grown in the *güertu* outside the kitchen door.

{% newthought 'When I moved to Spain' -%}, I learned that there are things about your native language that you know without knowing that you know them. No native speaker of English would ever say that there was a red big car parked on the street. We are completely unaware, as native speakers, of an unwritten rule of English; that there is a definitive order of adjectives that simply must be adhered to, or our speech will sound off. People learning English as a second language however, study this rule. They have to practice in order to internalize the order of adjectives.

The same kind of cultural learning takes place with the meaning of the words _tapas_ and _pintxos_. They are not, as some authors would have you believe, interchangeable regional or dialectical synonyms. They are, in fact, two different types of food, served in different ways, and with different cultural meanings. Moreover, everyone in Spain I have discussed the topic with innately knows what is a _tapa_ and what is a _pintxo_. Perhaps, like native English speakers and the adjective rule, they are not aware that they know it until it is pointed out to them, but know it they do.

## Tapas vs Pintxos

For the rest of us, latecomers to and adult learners of the intricacies of Spanish snacking culture, here is a brief outline of the difference between a _tapa_ and a _pinxto_:

**A** _**tapa**_ **is a small portion of a larger dish. A** _**pintxo**_ **is a dish-in-itself.**{% sidenote 'sn01' 'If you will excuse the philosophical joke of interest to exactly two people on the planet, **Ein Pintxo ist ein Gericht an sich** --- _we know not this dish as it is in itself, but only know its appreances_ (Prolegomena, § 32)' %} 

That's really all there is to the distinction. If it is a small portion of a thing you can order in a larger size, it's a _tapa_. If it only comes in one size; tiny and precious, it's a _pintxo_.

There are other, more spurious distinctions between the two, but while widely accepted, they are not the crux of the matter.[^1]

## The Asturian Pinchu

And then there is the curious case of the Asturian word _pinchu_. Originally it was solely a term for the mode of fishing for certain types of fish (Merluza chief among them), meaning by long-line instead of by net.[^2]

However, over the last few decades, it has come to mean a couple of different, sometimes confusing, things related to both _tapas_ and _pintxos_. Firstly, it has become the local term for that morning snack known in the rest of Spain as _almuerzo_. In this guise; as [_la hora del pinchu_](/culture/meal-times/#la-hora-del-pinchu), a _pinchu_ is (almost exclusively) either a tapa of _tortilla de patata_ on bread or a _bocadillo._

Secondly, in the context of bars and sidrerías, the _pinchu_ is now  a catch-all term for both _tapas_ and _pintxos_. Usually carried on trays around the room for you to select from, a pinchu is as likely to be a slice of tortilla on bread as it is to be a _bollo preñáu_.

So if you are in Asturias, the confusion returns, but there is a way out: just call all snacky things *un pinchu*.

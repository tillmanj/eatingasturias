{% epigraph 'People who love to eat are always the best people.' 'Julia Child' 'The French Chef, WGBH' %}

{%newthought 'food culture is the context'%} in which food exists. That is the best definition of [food culture](/culture/) I can come up with, and the ways it expresses itself in a place can sometimes be less than obvious. To help you immerse yourself in the food culture of Asturias more completely, I have compiled some pointers that will hopefully lessen the instances of confusion you might experience while in Asturias.


## The Basics
A few things to know before you arrive:

**Portion Sizes** are large. Much larger than elsewhere in Spain. Larger than some places in the US, even. Asturians love to eat and portions are designed around the idea that every meal should be an entire days sustenance, just in case.

**Pinchos** are a different thing here than they are in other parts of Spain. While there are identifable differences between [tapas and pinxtos](/culture/primer/tapas-and-pintxos.html) in other places in Spain, the important thing to remember in Asturias is that they all fall under the label *pinchu*, and some other things do as well.

People will wish you a good meal. Expect to hear ***buen provecho*** not just from your waiter as you might in other parts of Spain, but by people passing your table on their way into or out of the place you are eating.

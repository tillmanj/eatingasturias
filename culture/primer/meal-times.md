You would be forgiven for thinking that people in Spain are always eating. Forgiven precisely because it is true. Spain is a great nation of grazers, moving throughout their day from one mealtime to the next, never more than an hour or two from the next nibble. 

Lest you think I am comparing them to great plodding cows, let me say explicitly that I am not. I am rather more put in mind of goats -- who ramble over great distances each day, browsing on a little of this and a little of that as they go. Almost always in motion, and when not in motion, eating. This caprine browsing seems an apt metaphor for the Spanish food day.

However, they do not snack absentmindedly, or while doing other things. It is not for them this American eating at the desk, snacking throughout the day as a reflex. No, each snack, no matter how small, must have its appointed time slot and name. For a people who are notably relaxed about most things, it is this, meal times and names and appropriate victualing thereof, that they have decided to be very serious about. Let's take a look at the maximal number of meals a Spaniard might eat during the day, so as to get an idea of what might be available to us, the [visitor to Asturias](/visit/), at each period of the day.

## Desayuno
*First Breakfast: from 7 to 9 am*

Many people in Spain completely skip this meal entirely, having nothing but a cup of [coffee](/culture/primer/coffee.html) before leaving for work. Those who do eat *desayuno* at home opt for a combination of carbohydrates and sugars. Common breakfast sweets include cake (*bizcocho*), [cookies](/recipes/desserts/cookie/) (*galletas*) dunked in coffee, and various [pastries](/recipes/desserts/pastry/). On weekends or special days, *churros con chocolate* are a very popular *desayuno*.

**Where:** Most people eat this breakfast at home. Visitors should head to their hotel bar, or a nearby pastry shop.

## La Hora del Pinchu
*Second Breakfast: from 10 to 11 am*
{% marginnote 'mn-meals-01' 'The common translation of magdelena to muffin is incorrect. Cakes, and thus cupcakes, are made via the creaming method where high-speed whipping of butter and sugar, and then eggs, creates a light and fluffy texture, whereas muffins are stirred like other quickbreads. And since every magdalena recipe I have ever seen called for creaming the fat and sugar, they are 100% cupcakes. The icing has nothing to do with whether or not it is a cupcake.' %}
Known as *almuerzo* in most of Spain, this it the time for the second coffee of the day, and possibly more pastry. Savory food makes its first appearance in the Asturian day, with [bars](/visit/bars/) and *cafeterías* in full swing now, serving *tortilla de patata* and *bocadillos* filled with *chorizo*, *lomo*, or *pollo*. Pastries are never far away, and the un-iced cupcakes called *magdalenas* make an appearance.

**Where:** the closest *bar-cafetería* to where you happen to be. The best options are near business areas with offices. These combination cafes and bars are packed with office workers on break and retirees reading the sports paper all morning.

## Aperitivo or Vermut
*Pre-lunch drink or snack: from 12 to 2 pm*

Confined almost entirely to the weekend (particularly Sunday), and timed to begin when mass lets out, this is the most Spanish of all Spanish meal times. Essentially designed to solve the problem of not wanting to go home after church, but it not being time to eat lunch yet, this institution has seen a resurgence of late, after falling into obscurity in the decades after [Franco](/culture/primer/franco.html)'s death. The focus is on drinks rather than food, and there has been something of a craft *[vermut](/culture/products/vermut/)* renaissance as a result.

Food does play a part, as it always does when drinking in Spain, and since this is Asturias, the offerings are heartier than elsewhere. *Raciones* are commonly on offer, and many a number of vermouth bars have signature pinchos to try.

**Where:** The traditional choice is the *vermut* bar between the church and your house. Now the bars aren't so clustered around the church, and it is possible to have a vermouth session in just about any medium-sized city. Try to seek out a place that has craft vermouths, or even better, makes their own.

## La Hora De Comer
*Lunch: from 2 to 4 pm*

{% marginnote 'mn-meals-02' 'The *menú del día* has a fascinating history that is probably a lot shorter (and weirder) than you think. I have put together a comprehensive [history of the menú del día](/culture/history/contemporary/menu-del-día.html) if you would like to know the story behind this Spanish lunch institution.' %}
Also known as *la comida*, this is the main event. Whether eaten at home or in a restaurant, lunch is the main meal of the day in Asturias, and in Spain generally. When eating outside the home, Spaniards most often choose a *menú del día* which consists of three courses plus drink and bread for a set price. That price is usually somewhere between €10 and €15 per person.

The *menú del día* follows a general pattern of a lighter first course followed by a heavier meat-centric second course and a third dessert (and maybe coffee) course.

### Primeros
{% marginnote 'mn-meals-03' 'There is a sub-category of *menú del día* that goes by the name *menú obrero* or *menú anticrisis* and is usually considerably cheaper, only available during the work week, and usually only found in restaurants located in industrial parks or working-class neighborhoods. In these menus the *primero* options are replaced by a single option appetizer (*entrante*) and there are usually only two options for the *segundo*, now called the *primero*. Additionally the final course is often dessert **or** coffee, not both.' %}
First courses in a *menú del día* usually offer two or three courses. The best will offer your choice of a salad, a soup, and either a rice or pasta dish. The bread and drinks appear with this course. Common first course options include *garbanzos estofados*, *ensalada de jamón*, and *maccarones a la Asturiana*.

Be warned, in Asturias this course will be the size of the main course (*segundo*) in other places. Fortunately, it is now relatively common to be able to order a *medio menú* which lets you choose either the *primero* or *segundo* for a reduced price. (*see my [Asturian Food Culture Primer](/culture/primer/#portion-sizes) for more information*{:.parenthetical})

### Segundos
Second courses are almost always meat courses, and the best places offer you a choice of poultry, pork or beef, and fish dishes. A rare few will have a vegetarian option as well, though it will rarely be advertised as such. Vegetarians will have more luck asking if they can order two primeros instead, where there are more options to choose from. Common second course dishes in Asturias include *escalopines al Cabarales*, *carne gobernada*, and *patatas con picadillo y huevo*.

In the interest of [seasonality](/recipes/seasonality/), I would skip places that offer *fabada* or *pote asturiano* in the warmer months. Those stews are best enjoyed in cold weather, and offering them year round is a pretty good indicator that you might be in a tourist restaurant offering sub-par food.

### Postres
No proper meal can exist without a dessert course. And in Asturias the desserts are very often house-made. As a matter of fact, the best places for *menú del día* only serve *postres caseros*. Common options on this part of the menu in Asturias include *arroz con leche*, *tarta de abuela*, and *tarta de queso*.

### Sobremesa
An essential part of the Spanish lunch is the time spent after dessert around the table. *Digestivos* will perhaps make an appearance, along with another coffee or tea for those who eschew alcohol. Conversation will continue for as long as there are still people at the table, and no one will leave until they have to (to go back to work, or to an appointment). (*there is more information about [sobremesa](/culture/sobremesa.html) elsewhere on the site*{:.parenthetical})

**Where:** While most restaurants in Asturias offer a *menú del día* the absolute best options are found away from the touristy parts of town. You will never as good a lunch downtown in the shadow of the cathedral as you will on the outskirts of town in an industrial estate in the shadow of a power plant.

## Merienda

*afternoon snack: from 5 to 7 pm*

The afternoon snack is a sacred obligation in Spain, first inculcated in grade school, and carried throughout life. It is an dual-purpose meal time, serving as both a tide-me-over for the peckish and as after-work beers for the social. Often eaten in bars by adults leaving work (or just getting out of the house after a day of domestic labor) and around kitchen counters by the younger set, it is a catch-as-catch-can affair, with snacks making an appearance from all the other meals of the day. As is usual in Spain, sweets predominate, but the number and variety of savory options is higher than during morning snacking.

Popular snacks at this time include *bizcocho*, sandwiches, *tablas* of cheese or cold cuts, and *churros*.

**Where:** For the visitor to Asturias, the best place for *merienda* is, without a doubt, the *bar-cafetería*. This Spanish institution caters to all sorts, and in mid-afternoon you'll find school kids having sandwiches next to grandmas in impeccable makeup chatting over milky coffees, next to office workers having *cañas* of lager and retired men playing cards at square tables while they nurse their wine or cocktail. As a bonus, the only snack in a *bar-cafetería* that isn't home made is potato chips.

## Tapas
*evening snack: from 8 to 10 pm (or later)*

For American and British visitors to Spain, this can be the most confusing (and frustrating) time of the day. You are looking around for a restaurant to eat dinner, but none are open yet. "Surely not everyone can wait until late into the night to eat" you explain to your partner. And you are right. They are all eating, just not dinner yet. They are in the bars, having *tapas*, *pintxos*, or *pinchus*, depending on where you are in the country. Some are out for a quick snack and a drink with friends before dinner (especially if they didn't have a chance to *merendar* earlier), some are eschewing the coming dinner period entirely, choosing to roam from bar to bar having a snack in each one, and some haven't decided what to do yet.

Regardless, you aren't going to find a good Asturian restaurant serving dinner yet, so you might as well wade in and get in the swing of things. If you aren't up for full-on snacking, and simply need something to do during this time, you might consider joining the great Spanish pastime of *El paseo* -- the pre-dinner ramble through town. See the sights, people watch, have a drink or two along the way. (*there is more information about [el paeo](/culture/el-paseo.html) if you are interested*{:.parenthetical})

**Where:** You have the full gamut of options here, from a slice of *tortilla de patata* at a local *chigre* through any number of types of local bars, to the high-end grazing places with a reputation for architectural constructions and walls full of awards for their past accomplishments. No matter where you choose, there will be several things to try while you wait around for the restaurants to open.

## Cena
*dinner: from 9 to 11 pm*

Dinner (particularly in Summer) is the meal where Spain's stubborn insistence in remaining in the [wrong time zone](/culture/franco/#time-zone) is most apparent. While the rest of their longitudinal compatriots are finishing up their main courses or are well into their desserts and drinks, Spaniards are just sitting down to dinner. Traditionally dinner was a small meal, eaten at home except on special occasions, and usually consisting of salad, *tortilla de patata*, or *huevos rotos* -- things that were either made ahead of time or did not require long preparation. These days the options are wider, and restaurants often reproduce their lunch menus for dinner, or extend a three course *menú* into a 5, 7, or 9 course *degustacion*. But in Asturias there are two types of places that have long been focused on dinner.

**Where:** In Asturias I can think of no better way to eat dinner than at a traditional *[sidrería](/visit/sidrerias/)* or *[parilla](/visit/parillas/)*. In both places you will find a festive atmosphere, lots of cider being poured, and a full menu (*la carta*) to satisfy whatever your cravings might be.

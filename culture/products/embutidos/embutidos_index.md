{% epigraph 'I am not an intellectual. An intellectual is someone who looks at a sausage and thinks of Picasso, whereas I just say "pass the mustard".'

{% newthought 'Everyone in Spain,'%} and more and more people outside the peninsula, know the two most famous Asturian sausages now. The smoked chorizo and morcilla are famous, and protected by a {% glossary DOP -%}. But there is a whole world of other local Asturian sausages; some easy to find, some very local and obscure. 

This is my attempt to catalog all of the local sausages in Asturias in one place. Use this as your guide to what to eat on your next visit. Many of these sausages are very regionally specific. Some are found only in very small areas. Some of the others however, are widely available anywhere in Asturias. A few are available (and famous) throughout Spain. Those you will find it easy to procure the States, or import.

First a couple of words about the potentially confusing definitions of various sausage-like things in Asturian and Spanish common use. The most general term for sausages is embut√≠u or embutido, respectively. This is the broadest category and is defined as "(usually chopped) meat and other things stuffed into a casing." Salchicha is almost the same term except it means "meat and other things stuffed into a casing." Note the subtle difference. While chosco is an embutido, it is not a salchicha. That makes salchicha pretty much exactly to what an English speaker thinks of as "sausage". A fiambre however is a cold cut or luncheon meat. All precooked or cured meats that are sliced and served cold or hot are fiambres.

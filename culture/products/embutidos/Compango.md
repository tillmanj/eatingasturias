It is impossible to talk about food in Asturias without talking about _compango_.

From the vulgar Latin _[companĭcus](https://dle.rae.es/compango)_, “things that go with bread” it has come to mean “things that go in _fabada_”. And while it is common in other stews in Asturias, and in other dishes as well, it is most famous as the _sacramentos_ that go with beans.

## Definition
_Compango_ is a selection of (at least) three different meats; two sausages; _morcilla_ and _chorizo_, and some smoked pork belly. Traditionally, it contains four: _morcilla_, _chorizo_, _lacón_ and _tocino_. Let’s look at each individually, and see what you can use as substitutes in the States if you are making a _fabada_ at home.

### _Chorizo_

_Chorizo asturiano_ is an uncured sausage, and is smoked, usually over oak. The very best kinds in Asturias bear a serious resemblance to the kind of smoked sausage you get in really good diners in the States. You can easily substitute any of the major brand “Chorizo. Smoked sausage” types you find in the average grocery store. To order authentic _chorizo asturiano_, check my [Asturian Food Suppliers](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Asturian_Food_Suppliers_in_the_United_States "Asturian Food Suppliers in the United States") page.

### _Morcilla_

_Morcilla_ is a blood sausage, made in Asturias from pig’s blood, ground meat, onions, and paprika. Relatively easy to find, particularly if you live near a Mexican _carnicería_, as the Mexican _moronga_ is interchangeable. If not, I highly recommend the [DESPAÑA brand](https://despanabrandfoods.com/products/a-despana-morcilla). Both because it is immensely cheaper than places that mark up Spanish products 1000% and pretend it’s because of import fees, and because the recipe they use is a traditional Asturian one.

### _Lacón_

_Lacón_ is smoked pork shoulder. It’s as simple as that. Always air cured, always smoked, sometimes heavily salted, like country hams in the south-eastern United States. This should be a breeze for anyone to get a hold of in the States.

### _Tocino_ / _Panceta_

Bacon! _Tocino_ in Asturias is smoked, like American bacon, not just cured like Italian _pancetta_. The only trick is that you really should have a big thick piece, so you may want to hunt down some slab bacon for the authenticity.

## Uses
The most famous use of _compango_ is, of course, in _fabada_. However, it is an indispensable part of Asturian cooking, and the longer I live here, the more uses I find for it.

You can slice it and fry it to put on top of your _[fariñes](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Fari%C3%B1es "Fariñes")_ (grits), toss it into your lentils (or any other beans) instead of a ham hock, or grill it up and serve it with some bread as a _parillada_ (cookout).

{% epigraph 'Tradition is a guide and not a jailer.' 'W. Somerset Maugham.' 'Mr. Maugham Himself (1954)' %}

{% newthought 'The foods we make to keep,'%} the stores we lay by, these are honest and unavoidable expressions of our food culture. They tell us what we can waste in extravagant preparations, and what we dare not waste any of, transforming even the most suspect bits into something approximating a delicacy. The story of where we come from, and the hardships we have come through, are told in what we preserve and how we preserve it. These foods, over time, become the products that define our food culture -- artisanal expressions of past privations, elevated now into celebrations of taste and ingenuity.

I am not interested in debating legalistic definitions of what is artisanal or not. Partially because, as Justice Potter Stewart said "*I know it when I see it*".{% sidenote 'm01' 'Supreme Court Justice Stewart was describing his threshold test for obscenity in Jacobellis v. Ohio, and himself paraphrasing Arthur Conan Doyle who in *The Hound of the Baskervilles* has Sherlock Holmes comment "I know what is good when I see it." ' %} And partially because what I am talking about is the general class of artisanal foods produced in Asturias and associated closely with that place, not about the *bona fides* of one particular producer.

## Sidra Natural
The most famous Asturian product, cider, is the defining feature of the region. Without exaggeration, I can confidently say that life in Asturias revolves around this green-gold liquid. For that reason, there is much to be said about it.

## Craft Beer
Spain is an enthusiastic beer drinking nation, and it is finally beginning to develop the craft brewing movement that befits such a sudsy place. In my estimation, the majority of the craft brewing is being done in the north of the country, especially concentrated in an arc from the Basque Country to western Asturias. While not as pervasive as cider making, craft brewing is now relatively common across Asturias, and a number of excellent breweries exist.

## Cheese
Forty cheeses. Fifty cheeses. Maybe one hundred cheeses. It all comes down to how you count them. No matter how many cheeses you think Asturias has, the certain thing is, it’s a lot. More than any other region in Spain by a wide margin. By my count it is just over 320 individual cheeses in roughly 100 styles, organized by seven general types.

## Embutidos
There are quite a number of sausages and sausage-adjacent things made in Asturias. Not as many as cheeses, mind you, but that would be a Herculean feat. Regardless, there are a huge variety of traditional forms of *charcuterie* to explore.{% sidenote 's02' 'The French *charcuterie* as opposed to the Spanish *charcutería* for the simple fact that while technically the Spanish term can mean both the art of preparing meat products and to the store specialized in preparing them, the second definition is the **only** one you will ever hear used in Spain.' %}

## Wine
Winemaking in Asturias is a relatively small, relatively new thing. Having been so concentrated on cider, and it's attendant apple orchards for thousands of years, it is only recently that anyone has made any serious attempt to grow wine grapes in the region. However, there is now a {% glossary DOP %} Canges de Narcea that is beginning to put out very decent wines in the region.

## Other Craft Foods
The above categories are not the sum total of artisan food products in Asturias. The ingenuity and resourcefulness of people makes that a certain impossibility. I have rounded up all the one-off and niche products into a category of their own.

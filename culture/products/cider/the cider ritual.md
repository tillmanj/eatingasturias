{% newthought 'Welcome to the land of cider.'%} Asturias produces 80% of all the cider in Spain, and [drinks even more](/culture/cider-consumption/). It is not out of place to say that life in Asturias revolves around sidra. Social life in Asturias most certainly revolves around the sidrería - the cider house. 

Cider has been made in Asturias for roughly 1,000 years, and since the 18th century has been so wildly popular that only now, in the 21st century, is there any real movement to produce anything other than cider, meaning wine or craft beer, in the territory.

If you want to know more, I have a more in depth history of cider in Asturias. For now, let’s look at cider houses and what to expect in one. 

## When To Drink Cider
Cider drinking commences at lunch in Asturias, with one notable exception. Gentlemen of a certain age, reading their newspaper alone during *[la hora del pinchu](/culture/meal-times/#la-hora-del-pinchu)* are allowed to order a bottle of cider and have it poured for them. This is, coincidentally, the only time that it is socially acceptable to drink cider alone. All other cider drinking (at least in public) is a social ritual.

Anytime from lunch on is a perfect time for *una botella o dos*. In my experience cider drinking peaks in the late afternoon or early evening, and tapers off as the cocktail bars and craft beer joints get rolling around 7 or 8 pm.

## Where To Drink Cider
There is no shortage of bars, taverns, terraces, and even corner stores serving cider in Asturias. Indeed, it is nearly impossible to avoid cider in Asturias, but why would you want to do that?

Disclaimer: Naming of businesses is as fast and loose in Spain as it is in the States. Much like my favorite pool hall and bar in the States has “cafe” in its name, you can find sit down restaurants in Asturias called “Chigre …” and plenty of sidrerías are just called “bar …”

### Bar-Tienda
The [bar-tienda](/culture/) or *ultramarinos*, is a special kind of place in Asturias. Mostly found in small villages, these are a combination of grocery store, hardware store, bar, and owners house. The American general store is the closest thing I can think of to it. The small village pubs of rural Ireland that have a grocery room and perhaps a gas pump outside are very similar, and both those pubs and stores serve the same social purpose as the bar-tienda.

### Chigre
Essentially, this is your corner bar. A chigre is a local bar, focused primarily on cider these days, though almost all of them have at least one beer and one wine selection. Usually they do not have much (or anything) in the way of food. They are not good for large groups, nor for hungry people though.

### Sidrería
This is both the catch-all term for places that focus on serving cider, and a pretty specific type of place, at least to most people. The essential aspects of a proper sidrería are:

- **Table service**. While you might get a bottle dropped off for you at a chigre, a sidrería almost certainly has wait staff circulating to make sure you have all the cider you require. As a matter of fact, in most sidrerías it is impossible to sit at a bar.
- **Substantial food**. At a chigre you can (maybe) get snacks. At a sidrería you can get dinner. Some will be full-blown restaurants, some will have a chalkboard outside with a menu of the day, but all of them will feed you should you want to.

### Llagar
A llagar is (among other things) a cider mill -- a more or less commercial maker of cider. While some are purely industrial affairs, dedicated entirely to the production, bottling and shipping of cider, many of them now incorporate a sidrería into their production facilities, allowing for a really unique experience.

Sidrerías are my personal favorite of places to drink cider, by far. When you find one that fits you well, it is very easy to spend an entire evening there.

## How To Order Cider
Now that you have found a salubrious place in which to drink your cider, you need to actually get some of the green gold into your greedy hands. How you go about this varies depending on where you are. Asturian cider houses, no matter what they are called, have their own etiquette and norms of behavior. Once you have picked a place to go, here’s what to expect. 

### In a bar-tienda
For the cider drinker, the defining feature of the *bar-tienda* is the lack of table service. Like a British or Irish pub, service is at the bar, and in the smallest examples, no tables may exist at all.

### In a chigre
In a functional sense, a *chigre* is a *bar-tienda* without anything other than cider for sale.

## How To Drink Cider


### Poured for you 
*the local way*

Having your cider poured for you by an accomplished escanciador is the height of cider drinking in Asturias.

### From a mechanical escanciador 
*the tourist way*

### From the bottle 
*for experts only*

The true test of whether or not an immigrant has integrated into Asturian culture is the ability to *escanciar* -- to pour the cider yourself from far over head into a glass held as low as possible.

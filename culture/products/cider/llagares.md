{% newthought 'The commercial llagar' %}, the cider makers who quench the insatiable Asturian thirst for *sidra natural*, arose during the 19th century, and has maintained it's place at the center of Asturian cider culture since.

## Origins
During the 12th and 13th centuries, apple cultivation became so widespread and important that it led to the emergence of the concept of the *mampostería* land tenure contract; a forerunner of sharecropping in which unimproved land was loaned to a peasant to clear and plant apples on. In exchange the landowner would receive half of the fruit. The peasant retained his half, and the usufructary rights to whatever the land could be made to produce. These contracts were written to expire when the majority of the planted trees had dided; which was usually around 30 years.[^1]

It is out of these contracts that the beginnings of commercial cider pressing begins. 

The [early modern period](/culture/history/early-modern/) in Asturias was, broadly, one of privation and in many cases, starvation.

### 16th Century

### 17th Century
The 1600’s have come to be called the General Crisis, due to the widespread malnutrition, famine, inflation, and war that effected all parts of Europe.[^2]

### 18th Century
A mania for planting apples takes over Asturias. The concept of the *añada de sidra*; that of making biennial double crops to store sufficient cider for the low-producing year; begins to be employed by cider makers, and signals a constant and growing demand for the drink. Indeed, the records of the conceyu of Villaviciosa show an increase from roughly 300,000 liters of cider produced in 1753, to 4.5 million liters by the end of the century. That is a serious increase in production: tenfold in ~50 years!

## Consolidation
These commercial llagares have consolidated over time into a smaller and smaller number of larger and larger concerns. In 1958 there were 70 commercial llagares making _sidra natural_ in Asturias. By 1980 that number was just 216, and in 1989 it had shrunk further to 134.[^3] Currently, by my own count, there are roughly 125 commercial llagares in Asturias.

DOP[^1] Cabrales is the regulatory body for the Cabrales cheese. The official name of the group is **Consejo Regulador D.O.P. [Queso Cabrales](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Queso_Cabrales "Queso Cabrales").**

Inaugurated in 1981 by recognition of the EU, it began certifying cheese makers in the next year.

In 2000 the DOP created [Fundación Cabrales](https://www.fundacioncabrales.com/), a sub-organism for the management of the ripening caves used in the production of Cabrales cheese. The foundation also operates a model cheese ripening cave open to visitors in the village of Arenas de Cabrales.

[^1]: DOP stands for _Denominación de origen protegida_ and in English is **Protected Designation of Origin (PDO).** See [Asturian Quality Marks](https://eatingasturias.com/wiki/Asturian_Quality_Marks "Asturian Quality Marks") for a more complete discussion.

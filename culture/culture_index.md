Food and Culture are inseparable. In many ways, it is redundant to even say ‘food culture’, as our approach to what we make, cook, serve, and eat is determined by, and in turn determines, many other aspects of our way of life – our culture. As such, our food is much more than simply what sustains us. It **is** us: it expresses our class divisions, regional differences, historical developments, and sense of belonging. [^1]

This is my exploration of Asturian food culture. Seen through the lens of an immigrant chef with an obsession for food scholarship and a camera. I investigate the ground (sometimes literally) that Asturian foodways grow out of. Here I work from a definition of food culture as the Landscape, History, Ingredients, and Products that make up Asturian culinary practice as I find it now.

Asturian cuisine, whether it be focused on the sea or on the mountain, is dominated by <em>{% glossary platos de cuchara %}</em>. While these stew dishes are a defining feature of Spanish cooking more widely, no where are they more prominent than in Asturias.

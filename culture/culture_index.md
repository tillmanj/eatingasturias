This is my exploration of Asturian food culture. Seen through the lens of an immigrant chef with an obsession for food scholarship and a camera. I investigate the ground (sometimes literally) that Asturian foodways grow out of. Here I work from a definition of food culture as the Landscape, History, Ingredients, and Products that make up Asturian culinary practice as I find it now.

Food and Culture are inseparable. In many ways, it is redundant to even say ‘food culture’, as our approach to what we make, cook, serve, and eat is determined by, and in turn determines, many other aspects of our way of life – our culture. As such, our food is much more than simply what sustains us. It **is** us: it expresses our class divisions, regional differences, historical developments, and sense of belonging. [^1]

In this section of the website, I explore the whole sweep of history in Asturias from remotest ice ages to the current day, through the lens of the foods eaten here, the crops grown here, what was imported and what was exported as delicacies to other places.

## What Is Food Culture?
For our purposes here, let's consider food culture to be "*how you get the ingredients you cook with, whyy you chose those ingredients, what you do with them before you cook them, how you cook them, how you present what you cook, who you share it with, and how you behave before, during, and after eating it*". 

In short, **food culture is the context in which food exists**.

## The Culinary Landscape
We begin with the literal landscape; the physical environment in which a food culture exists. It is nearly impossible to have a food culture that is completely divorced from the climate, geography, weather patterns, human settlements, land uses, infrastructure, and general relationship between the people and the land they inhabit.

To me, this is a fascinating aspect of our food cultures, and I spend quite a bit of time researching how the landscape forms our culture. I delve into the two great divisions of landscape as it pertains to food culture, the [physical landscape](/culture/natural-environment/); formed by erosion, weathering, tectonic activity and made up of mountains, rivers, plains, and sea, and the the [human landscape](/culture/built-environment/); shaped by human activity and comprising the cities, roads, farms, urban areas, and infrastructure that moves people (and food) around.

## Food History
The historical context is just as important as the physical context when it comes to understanding a food culture. Other cultures who were neighbors of, conquerors of, or conquered by the culture in question all leave their marks on the food and food customs of the culture. Asturian food history spans a truly amazing amount of time: from Neanderthal cooking and medicine 49,000 years ago[^3] to the rise of Latino immigrants in Spain from 3% of the population to 14% (equal to the US latino immigrant population) in just two decades in the early 21st century.[^2]

Between those two bookends lies a celt-iberian cultural substrate changed over time by influences from Phoenician, Roman, Visigothic, pan-Catholic, Arabic, Mozarabic, Sephardic, South American, French, and other cultures and cuisines.[^4] Each of these cultures contributed something to the food culture of Asturias. Some more than others, and some in less direct and obvious ways.

## Common Ingredients
One of the less visible, but still incredibly important ways that a culture contributes to the food culture of another group is through the sharing of ingredients. What we grow determines what we eat, obviously, so ingredients borrowed from our neighbors, much more so than fashionable dishes copied for a season and then forgotten, mark their true contribution to our food culture.

From the French beans that makes possible one of the most-loved Asturian seafood dishes to the New World corn and beans that dominate the Asturian table, straight through to the Argentinian Connection that informs so much modern Asturian comfort food, the ingredients we use define not just who we are, but who we are connected to - who we share a table with.

As a novice farmer and avid smallholder, I am obsessed with the raw ingredients, the *materia prima*, of Asturian cooking. I grow them, cook them, write about them - my life revolves around them. I am an unabashed booster for local produce, local farmers, home gardens, and seed conservation. I aim to catalog the entirety of Asturian garden produce and commercial agriculture for local and regional consumption.

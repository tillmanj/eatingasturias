## Timeline

### 46,000 BCE - El Sidron Cave

El Sidrón cave in Piloña has offered up not just thousands of neanderthal fossils, but the earliest traces of gastronomic history in Asturias. These 50,000 year old remains are remarkably well preserved. So much so that when they were discovered in 1994, the initial assumption is that they were from the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). Only later were they dated to the Upper Paleolithic. To put this in perspective, this is twenty thousand years before the last massive glaciers recede from Asturias. Mushrooms, mosses, and pine nuts were notable parts of the diet of the denizens of El sidrón.

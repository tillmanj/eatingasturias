Carthage, Rome, and Beyond

Asturias, though the aegis of the Celtiberian peoples known as the Astures, enter the historical record in the third century BCE. Serving as mercenaries in the Punic wars on the side of Carthage, they feature widely in the wars of subjugation the Romans waged throughout the northwest of Iberia. So fierce was their resistance and inhospitable their territory that though they had the emperor himself at the head of seven legions, even once they formally surrendered in 25 BCE, they were never fully conquered, and for most, their way of life changed little if at all. Indeed, Romanization was very slow, incomplete, and near impossible. Revolts by the Cantabri and Astures are recorded in 24, 22, 19 and 16 BC. A second Asturian revolt in 54 CE took fourteen years to put down. 

Hispania was the rural hinterland for the Roman empire – a place to grow food for the metropolitan Rome. Indeed, so marginal was it that what we take now as being its cuisine was in fact, the military fare of the Roman legions stationed there. As Rafael Chabrán put it, "Much of what we think of today as being typically Spanish were, in fact, the staples of the Roman diet. Bread, cheese, olives and olive oil. wine, and roasted meat, when it was to be had, were the standard fare of the Roman soldiers in Hispania."

And Asturias was the hinterland of Hispania – a place unfit for wheat, grapes, and olive trees; the three big exports from the peninsula. Indeed, of the typical Roman (and Carthaginian) foodstuffs that make up the Spanish plate, only cheese plays a significant role in Asturian cuisine. 

However, Rome brought to Asturias a couple of culinary innovations that would be long-lasting. Firstly, and most importantly for the current character of Asturian food culture, they planted apple orchards in huge numbers. 

In addition, Gijón became a center for production and export of two very important Roman foodstuffs; salted fish and garum. This much-loved Roman condiment was not only the forerunner of the modern Worchestershire Sauce, but the most profitable export in Hispania.

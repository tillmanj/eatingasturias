This is the age of Visigoths, Peasantry, and the All-Consuming Church

In 409 A.D., Germanic peoples known as the Vandals, Alans, Swabians, Goths, and Visigoths invaded what was known as Roman Spain. These visigothic conquerors, as the ycame to be known, particularly those who settled in Asturias and eventually became the Kings of Asturias, did not disturb (or contribute much to) the already existing food culture in Asturias. They were cattle raising people who practiced transhumance like the locals did, and they reinforced those practices, as well as the primacy of vegetables in the diet. While politically, much changed in Asturias and Spain in the medieval period, very little changed in food culture.

One notable contribution though, and one that reverberates throughout Asturias to this day is the word *escanciar*, used solely in Asturias to mean the pouring of cider from overhead, but to the Germanic tribes of the fifth century as the word for pouring wine into a cup.[^1] Other examples of Visigothic language that are important in Asturian cuisine today include the words *estaca*, from *spitō* which is also the origin of *espicha*, *estofa* (stuff) from whence *estufa* (stove) and *estofado* (stew: stuff cooked on the stove), and *lonja* - the building that fish are sold in.[^2] [^3]

The autarky of the family farm (casería) became the primary goal of bread labor, and remained so in Asturias until the modern period. Tastes were very conservative, and food revolved around the trinity of bread, pork, and beans. 

## Timeline

- 711 CE - Arabs and Berbers from North Africa invade the Iberian Peninsula and defeat the Visigoths. New methods in agriculture introduced by them include intensive irrigation, the use of animal droppings as fertilizers, im proved plows, and crop rotation. New foodstuffs introduced by the Arabs include rice, sugar, and saffron.
- 750 CE - Famine is followed by plague on the Iberian Peninsula.
- 803 CE - Ego Fakilo
- 915 CE - Crop failure causes a famine on the Iberian Peninsula that is ruled in the south by the Arabs, and in the north by Christian princes.
- 961 CE - The Arabs begin the production of the spice saffron on the Iberian Peninsula.
- 980 CE - Nodicia de kesos
- 1492 CE - In an attempt to reach Asia, Spanish navigator Christopher Columbus lands by accident in the Bahamas. His discovery of the New World will lead to the introduction of many new foods to Europe, among them potatoes, peppers, maize, tomatoes, pineapples, allspice, cacao, and turkey.

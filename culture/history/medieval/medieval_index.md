This is the age of Visigoths, Peasantry, and the All-Consuming Church

One notable contribution though, and one that reverberates throughout Asturias to this day is the word escanciar, used solely in Asturias to mean the pouring of cider from overhead, but to the Germanic tribes of the fifth century as the word for pouring wine into a cup.[Notes 3] Other examples of Visigothic language that are important in Asturian cuisine today include the words estaca, from spitō which is also the origin of espicha, estofa (stuff) from whence estufa (stove) and estofado (stew: stuff cooked on the stove), and lonja - the building that fish are sold in.

The autarky of the family farm (casería) became the primary goal of bread labor, and remained so in Asturias until the modern period. Tastes were very conservative, and food revolved around the trinity of bread, pork, and beans.

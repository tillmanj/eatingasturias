Asturias has an exceedingly long culinary history. While written records are scant until recent times, there has been a wealth of paleontological and archeological work done in Asturias which has helped to piece together the early food history of the region. This is my overview of that history. 

## Stone Age Food in Asturias
The earliest traces of gastronomy in Asturias date to 50,000 BCE, and are informed by archeology in the caves that dot the Cantabrian coast. Based on what we know currently, this is the beginning of human habitation in the area, and thus, the beginning of food history in the region.

## Bronze Age Trade
Reliable Asturian food history begins in the Atlantic Bronze Age (~1300-700BC). This period sees a network of economic and cultural exchange develop from Scotland to Portugal. This network led to a high degree of cultural similarity between coastal communities, including those in Asturias. Roasting spits, giant cauldrons, and flesh hooks (the earliest evidence of butchery in Asturias) all date to this era.

## Iron Age Hill Forts
Around the year 1000 BCE, Celtic culture was in bloom in Asturias. Whether this grew out of earlier Hallstatt expansions or dates very close to 600 is up for debate. What we do know is that a well-developed Celtic castro (hill fort) dwelling people called the Astures were resident throughout modern Asturias, and parts of Galicia and Le√≥n.

## Ancient Asturias
Asturias was a remote corner of the Roman hinterland that was *Hispania* -- seen as little more than a place to grow food for metropolitan Rome. But some of the most important changes in Asturian food culture take place in this era, including the introduction of the apple orchards that followed the Legions wherever they went.

## Visigothic & Medieval Foods
In 409 A.D., various Germanic peoples invaded what was known as Roman Spain. These visigothic conquerors in Asturias eventually became the Kings of Asturias. They did not much change the already existing food culture in Asturias. They were cattle raising people who practiced transhumance like the locals did, and they reinforced those practices, as well as the primacy of vegetables in the diet. While politically, much changed in Asturias and Spain in the medieval period, very little changed in food culture.

## Early Modern Foodways
The early modern period was one of massive upheaval in culture worldwide, and even insular Asturias was not immune to the culinary shocks brought on by the Columbian Exchange. Massive waves of out-migration and return defined life for much of Asturias during the period, bringing far-flung foodways back home with them.

## Contemporary Asturian Cuisine
There is much to say about contemporary food culture in Asturias. The years of fascist dictatorship were ones of hunger, and the tourism that supported the dictatorship continues to grow. As immigration from Latin America gains pace many of the best *escanciadores* in Asturias hail not from Oviedo or Grau, but from Caracas and Santo Domingo.

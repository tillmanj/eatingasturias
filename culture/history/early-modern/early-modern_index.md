Early Modern Asturias is the time from the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, the Columbian Exchange, Industrialization, Migration

### Columbian Exchange
*Main article: [The Columbian Exchange](/culture/history/early-modern/columbian-exchange.html)*

Try as they might, the Spanish conquistadores could not bend Mother Nature to their imperious will, and their demands that the Americas produce wheat bread and wine for their sacraments fell on the equally imperious deaf ears of nature. Instead, they learned the ways of potato, corn, pumpkin, tomato, bean, and chile pepper. Imagine Spanish food without tomatoes and pimentón! As impossible as imagining American food without the previously unknown pig!

### The Little Ice Age
1300 - 1850 CE

#### The Great Famine (1315–1317)

#### Thirty Year's War (1618–1648)
The Little Ice Age led to a decrease in agricultural productivity, inflating grain prices. Because most of Europe was an agricultural society at the time, this meant that the economy suffered. The economic downturn led to social, political and economic strife that contributed to the outbreak of war across Europe.[^1]

The Thirty Years’ War coincided with the harshest period of the Little Ice Age, from 1560 to 1660.

The 1600’s have come to be called the General Crisis
### The Indianos
Indianos is the name given to Asturians who went to the Americas to seek their fortunes in the 19th and early 20th centuries. They are responsible, in part, for one of the biggest developments in Asturian food distribution. Namely, the mass bottling of cider for export.

#### Argentina
Asturias gained a couple of interesting additions to its food culture from the Indianos as well. A man known as Anton de los Pontones who had been a gaucho in Argentina brought back the technique of cooking beef a la estaca, and adapted it to lamb. There is still a yearly festival de cordero estaca near where he was from.

Anton, and others like him, also gave rise to an interesting food adaptation – Asturian chimichurri. Modeled on the Argentinian/Uruguayan original, it has been adapted to local tastes, and now is wholly different, though it retains the name

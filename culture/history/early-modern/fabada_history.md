{%- newthought 'Fabada has a somewhat murky past,'-%} owing to the fact that, like most places, the food of the peasant and later the country dweller, was of little interest to those who wrote treatises on agriculture, travel narratives, and newspapers. Indeed, it is not until the 24th of July, 1884 that Fabada as a dish is mentioned in print.[^6] It is worth noting in that announcement, that fabada is already referred to as “traditional”.

So we know it is old enough to be considered a venerable part of Asturian cuisine in 1884, and we know, roughly, how old it can be, at least in it’s current guise. Fabada contains *phaseolus vulgaris* white beans, so it cannot (at least in a recognizable shape and thus under the same name) be older than 1492. Indeed, there are zero records of beans in European herbariums before 1543, though it is known from ships records that common beans were shipped into Spain in 1506 or thereabouts.[^10] 

So we have roughly 350 years between the introduction of the common bean to Spain and the veneration of fabada as a bedrock traditional dish. What went on in those years?

## Ancestors
To find out, we actually have to go much farther back in time. To the fall of the Roman empire in fact. Because the fall of the Roman empire is the rise not only of the Catholic church, but of Asturias. And the story of Fabada is the story of prosperity; of pigs in every forest and beans in every garden.

Most of medieval Europe ate some version of a perpetual stew, a *pottage*. That is exactly what it sounds like:

{% blockquote 'q01' '…an ever-changing broth enriched daily with whatever was available. The cauldron was rarely emptied out except in preparation for the meatless weeks of Lent, so that while a hare, hen or pigeon would give it a fine, meaty flavor, the taste of salted pork or cabbage would linger for days, even weeks.' 'Reay Tannahill' 'Food in History' %}

In Spain this was the *olla podrida*, the forerunner of not just fabada, but of almost every beloved regional stew in the country.[^8] Descended from the Jewish adafina stew, it was popular across the Iberian peninsula.[^9] It was described by Cervantes, through the words of Sancho Panza:

{% blockquote 'q02' '“*Aquel platonazo que está más adelante vahando me parece que es olla podrida, que por la diversidad de cosas que en las tales ollas podridas hay, no podré dejar de topar con alguna que me sea de gusto y de provecho*”<br /><br />That great big steaming dish looks like olla podrida to me, and since that sort of hotchpotch stew has got so many different things in it, I can’t fail to come across one that I’ll like and will do me good.' 'Miguel de Cervantes Saavedra' 'El ingenioso caballero Don Quijote de la Mancha (Parte II, Cap. XLVII)' %}

In the 16th and 17th centuries it was known as *la olla poderida*, referring to its place at the tables of the rich and powerful who could afford a stew with so many ingredients.[^11] It was only after the Bourbon restoration of the early 19th century that it fell out of fashion with the *poderosos* and took on it’s current, rotten, name.

## Conquistadors & Industrialists


As an interesting aside, one of the early bean cultivars to arise from the Iberian peninsula was called "favada", and all of the beans now accepted by the IGP for Fabes Asturianas are descended from that mutation.


## Modern Fabada

Sometime in the 16th century, the medieval olla podrida began to change in Asturias. People replaced the chickpeas typical of the stew with white runner beans. People were then planting many more runner beans as garden crops in Asturias. With this, the final connection to adafina was severed, and the dish became the fabada we recognize today. Once it had been a stew of chickpeas, chicken meat and eggs. Now it was now a dish of white beans and pork sausages.

To the south, in Castilla y León, as well as elsewhere, Chickpeas continued to reign supreme. Even as the singular olla podrida fragmented into as many cocidos as there are regions of Spain, the chickpeas remained. Not in Asturias though. Here, once the fabes entered the pot, there was no looking back.

Fortunately, this is a recipe that is easy to make all over the world. Read on for how to make an authentic fabada at home in the US, or elsewhere. (astute readers might be interested in comparing that most American of all soups, Senate Bean Soup[^5] to Fabada)

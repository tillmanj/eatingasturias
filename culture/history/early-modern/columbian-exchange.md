{% epigraph 'To ecologists, the Columbian Exchange is arguably the most important event since the death of the dinosaurs.' 'Charles C. Mann' '1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created' %}

{% newthought 'The Columbian Exchange'%} refers to the exchange of diseases, ideas, food crops, and populations between the “*New World*” (the Americas) in the Western Hemisphere, and the “*Old World*” (Afro-Eurasia) in the Eastern Hemisphere, in the late 15th and following centuries.[^1] The term was coined by Alfred W. Crosby, an American historian at the University of Texas at Austin. His 1972 book _The Columbian Exchange_, and subsequent volumes within the same decade cemented the term in the popular imagination.[^2] It is however, critically important to remember that the Columbian Exchange was an exchange of ingredients, **not an exchange of foods**. To quote Rachel Lauden:

{% blockquote 'BQ01' 'Pigs went to Mexico, dry-cured hams did not. Maize went to Europe, but treating maize with alkali did not. Chiles made it round the world, but pureed chile sauces did not either.'
'Rachel Lauden' 'Why Didn’t the Spanish Dry-Cure Ham in Mexico?' '[Why Didn’t the Spanish Dry-Cure Ham in Mexico?](http://www.rachellaudan.com/2023/03/why-didnt-the-spanish-dry-cure-ham-in-mexico.html) - Rachel Laudan. _Rachel Laudan_, 7 Mar. 2023' %}

The potato quickly became a staple crop in Asturias, as did corn.[^4] Corn was initially so popular in northern Spain that John Locke observed in the 1670s that it was grown throughout the Mediterranean region, where it had acquired the name “Spanish Bread”. So quickly did Spain adopt corn that they invented (as they often do) a story about how it was an indigenous Spanish plant.

Beans as well were enthusiastically incorporated into Asturian foodways. Indeed the American Phaseolus vulgaris quickly supplanted almost all other beans in cultivation, not just in Asturias, but throughout Europe. Notable "new world" food stuffs entered Asturian cooking in the three centuries following the Columbus expeditions. None of these staple Asturian ingredients were available prior to the Exchange.[^3]

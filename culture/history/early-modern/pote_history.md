{% newthought 'Pote is the classic stew of Asturias.' %} Yes, I know, Fabada is more famous these days, but hear me out. Pote is the most important stew in Asturias because it isn’t a stew at all; it is the whole complex of Asturian stews. Each pote has it’s own name, most of which contain the name of the pot they all once sprung from. Some have wriggled free of this naming convention though, and are named for other things, like the beans that make them famous. [Fabada](/recipes/soups/fabada.html) is one of those types of pote.

But to understand the place of pote in Asturias today, we have to go back to the beginning. And for most things in Europe, the beginning means "the end of the Roman empire".

## Endings & Beginnings

{% marginfigure 'mf01' 'assets/images/Spain_411_es.svg_.png' 'In a little under two years, Rome had lost control of 75% of the Iberian peninsula, and everyone was getting an education in new foodways.' %}
On a Tuesday somewhere between 28 September and 13 October 409 CE, Gothic Sueves crossed the Pyrenees into Roman Hispania. [^2] By the year 411 CE the Roman government had given up on having a permanent military presence in Spain except in a limited area of Tarraconensis that did not include any of Asturias. For all intents and purposes, Rome ceased to exist in Asturias in 411. What came next changed nothing and everything.

*Nothing* because Asturias remained a restive outlying area of an ill-defined province and were mostly left to govern themselves in day-to-day affairs. This is true in particular after 438; when the Suevi king Hermeric signs a peace treaty with the indigenous partially-Romanized, partially-Celtic populations in what is now Galicia and Asturias.

*Everything* because it is during this period that the Roman diet of identity lost its grip on the north of Spain, and influences from the rest of European cooking of the time take hold. The Suevi and Astures shared food predilections, and they were, after this time, celebrated instead of denigrated. Additionally, this moment begins a long process of de-centralization in the Iberian peninsula, one of the results of which will be distinct regional characters in farming and cooking. This is, properly, where Asturian cuisine can be said to begin.

As a result of this Germanic invasion[^5] and resettling of Spain, the relative value of certain foodstuffs changed. The indigenous livestock farming and dairying were elevated in line with the tastes of the Visigoths, whereas the Romans had seen this practice as barbarian and unsuitable food for civilized Citizens.[^3] Of particular note to the pastoralist indigenous Asturians and the newly arrived Visigoths is  Aristotle’s characterization of transhumance as the “mobile living fields” of the idlest (and thus least worthy) of all his types of people, dismissing them as ‘eaters of meat and drinkers of milk’. In this denigration, he is echoing the earlier words of Homer who judged the Cyclopes for not adopted a primarily vegetarian diet since their land produced an abundance of wheat, barley, and grapes. Alas, their cyclopian laziness led them instead to ranching, herding, and (*the horror*) hunting.


## Potaje, Adafina, Cocido
One thing that didn't change during late antiquity was the kitchen equipment in the average household. Generically called the *olla* and *patella*, these two items, roughly analogous to the modern use of “pot” and “pan”, give rise to the two most famous pieces of Spanish cookware; the three-footed olla and the wide flat paella (a *patella* that lost a “t” so to speak).[^4]{% marginnote 'mn01' 'The famous rice dish is called a *paella* only when it is cooked in the pan also called a *paella*. In all other circumstances, even with identical ingredients, it is an "*arroz*".' %}

The Roman *olla* (or earlier *aula*) was usually made of bronze and could be any size from a modest saucepan up to a cauldron used as a bain-marie.

Most of medieval Europe ate some version of a perpetual stew, a *pottage*, or in Spain then as now, a *potaje*. That is exactly what it sounds like:

{% blockquote 'q01' '…an ever-changing broth enriched daily with whatever was available. The cauldron was rarely emptied out except in preparation for the meatless weeks of Lent, so that while a hare, hen or pigeon would give it a fine, meaty flavor, the taste of salted pork or cabbage would linger for days, even weeks.' 'Reay Tannahill' 'Food in History' '' %}

By the 1450s, *potajes* were recognized as being so common and "womanly" as to not bear mentioning in important cookbooks for proper professional manly cooks:[^1]

{% blockquote 'q02' 'Other Lesser Pottages, such as stewed chard, cabbage, turnip greens, leeks, veal in Yellow Sauce, and plain shallot pottage, peas, frenched beans, mashed beans, sieved beans or beans in their shell, pork offal, brewet of pork tripe --- women are experts with these and anyone knows how to do them...' 'Guillaume Tirel (*Taillevent*)' 'Le Viandier, 154' '*From the 1892 Techener publication of the Vatican Manuscript:* D’AUTRES MENUZ POTAIGES, comme porée de bettes, chouz, navetz, poreaulx, veel au jaunet, et potaiges de ciboulles sans autre chose, poys, fèves frasées, pillez ou couliez, ou atout le haubert chaudun de porc, brouet aux yssues de porc, femmes en sont maistresses, et chascun le sçait faire…' %}

{% marginnote ‘mn03‘ 'In Arabic “a dafina“ means covered or buried, making it the direct cognate to the  Mishnaic/Aramaic “tomnin et ha’hamin”' %}In Spain. the *pottage par excellence*  was either a *dafina*, an Arabic word or a *hamin*, the Mishnaic word, both equivalent to the  later Ashkenazic *cholent* which spread north into France and Germany after the 1492 expulsion of the Jews from Spain. *Dafina* was used in the Arabic speaking south of the peninsula and *Hamin* in the north.[^6]

In both cases, the stew was mostly the same; cubed lamb, mashed onions, a whole grain, and cumin. Relatively quickly after its appearance, bean came to replace the whole grains, and the *dafina*/*hamin* split became more pronounced, with chickpeas preferred in the south and fava beans in the north.[^7]

{% marginnote 'mn04' 'It is worth noting here that at the time, there were more Jews living in Spain than in all other medieval European countries combined. And in marked contrast to the ghettos and shtetls of the northern European jewish concentrations, in Spain the Jews lived in every city, town, and village; sometimes as few as two or three families together in a farming hamlet.' %}This split would, over time, grow wider. Wide enough that now the southern descendent would maintain the Jewish heritage, despite the best efforts of certain writers to purge all “foreign” foods from Spain’s “national dish”, while the northern version would quickly adopt an all-pork [compango](/culture/products/embutidos/compango.html) and shed it’s Sephardic roots *almost* completely.[^8]
## Olla, Cocido, Pote
In the south of the peninsula, a *dafina*, now shortened to *adafina* like many words that came into Castellano from Arabic gave rise to Olla Podrida, which would go on to become the famous *cocido* that is sometimes mistakenly called the origin of *pote*.[^9]
{% marginnote 'mn05' 'Literally translated as “rotten pot” though perhaps as a misuse of the word _poderida_, which would give it the meaning of a “powerful pot”.[^8] Regardless of these linguistic quibbles that convince no one,[^10] one can imagine that the contents of an _olla podrida_ would indeed be powerful, sometimes in a very rotten way.' %}
However, we are going to set aside the story of cocido here, because it is my assertion that instead of being the child of cocido, pote is instead the sibling. It is the continuation of the northern *hamin* stew tradition which ran contemporaneously alongside the cocido, and completed the split between northern and southern Sabbath stews in Iberia.

The *conversos* in the northern Christianized kingdoms of the peninsula were quick to advertise their non-Jewishness by substituting pork for lamb in many traditional dishes. Pork sausages took the place of chicken, lamb, lamb sausage, and beef. The arrival of South American produce in the sixteenth century led to white beans becoming a prominent substitute for fava beans, and potatoes became a common addition.

We know that after the expulsion that Sephardic communities in both Italy and Tunisia added shredded greens to their *adafinas*, much as in Asturias a *pote* is not a *pote* without some [berza](/culture/ingredients/vegetables/berza.html) in it.

{% newthought 'What do I mean when I say' %} the *culinary landscape?* Do I mean the food system, in it's technocratic sense? Or do I mean the menu of food offerings available in a specific place -- the sociological factors that shape an industry that provides food to people?

I mean something different than either of those; I mean the hard facts that, right now, define the gastronomy of a place. Both the natural and the human conditions that make up the actually existing place. I think of that culinary landscape as being made up of three interdependent pieces; the **natural environment**, the **built environment**, and the **culinary mind**. Taken together, and defined mostly by their interplay, the culinary landscape emerges.

{% marginnote 'mn01' 'I am not dismissive of those concerns. I am simply not focused quite so heavily on them. There are many experts who write about food systems from a critical perspective that I enjoy reading and think are vital voices. Among them are [Marion Nestle](https://www.foodpolitics.com/), The [World Food System blog](https://www.foodsystemstories.org/) at ETH Zurich, [Charles Levkoe](https://link.springer.com/search?dc.creator=Charles%20Z.%20Levkoe), and [Molly D. Anderson](https://link.springer.com/search?dc.creator=Molly%20D.%20Anderson). ' %}I use this term to think about something that is usually missing from discussions of food systems. While technically a food system takes into account the physical and human factors of production and consumption, most discussion of food systems these days tends to either be focused on the global span of transportation systems that make up many macro-scale food systems, or on meta questions of environmental, racial, animal, and colonial issues. 

If food systems are comprised of four parts; production, processing, distribution, and consumption, then what I am talking about with the *culinary landscape* concept is the factors that shape and determine the first part of the food system - the production of food.


{% marginnote 'mn02' 'There is even more overlap between the concept of culinary landscape and that of what actual academics call *the [biocultural paradigm](https://socialsci.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Anthropology/Cultural_Anthropology/Cultural_Anthropology_(Evans)/01%3A_What_is_Anthropology/1.03%3A_Biocultural_Approach)*. I am looking at the culinary aspect of the interplay between nature and culture addressed in that paradigm.' %}
I suppose there is quite a bit of overlap between my term culinary landscape and the French term *terroir*, in that we are both interested primarily in the factors that influence the phenotype of of a crop: the environmental context, the farming practices, and the attitudes of the farmers producing them. Collectively these contextual characteristics have an effect on the crops that are grown - that is their *terroir*. They also have an effect on the habits, attitudes, and tastes, of the people who produce and consume those crops, especially when the four stages of a food system (production, processing, distribution, and consumption) are kept relatively local. That effect on the humans and their lived experiences makes up their culinary landscape.

When we talk about how the locations and processes used in Production and Processing impacts the organoleptic qualities of the food, we are discussing *terroir*. When we discuss how the geography, psychogeography, architecture, and infrastructure impact the locations and processes chosen for producing food, we are discussing *the culinary landscape*. 

## The Natural Landscape
The natural environment is the landscape and climate that determines the contours of what our food culture is by setting limits on what is possible. From the mountains to the sea, this is where we, and our food, come from. [*read more...*](/culture/landscape/natural-environment/)

## The Built Environment
The built environment is the changes we as humans have made to the landscape. Here is explore all of the farms, buildings, towns, cities, and special places we make, and how they impact our food culture. [*read more...*](/culture/landscape/built-environment/)

## The Culinary Mind
What I call the *culinary mind* is the set of both personal and culturally shared ideas and attitudes that inform and determine our food consumption behaviors. Just as much as the landscape or the climate, our shared attitudes set the boundaries of what is possible within our food culture. [*read more...*](/culture/landscape/culinary-mind/)

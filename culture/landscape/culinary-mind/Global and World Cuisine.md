Global Cuisine is my own term. I use it to describe the collection of dishes, preparations, and techniques that have become common or typical across many regions around the world. Once an ingredient, technique, or dish has been adopted widely enough that it is unremarkable to find it in some form in most places around the world, it is part of the Global Cuisine.

## Global or World Cuisine
A *world cuisine*, in my estimation, is one in which a dish or a type of dish has become popular throughout a large part of the world, but it retains it’s essential cultural context. A taco is an example of a part of world cuisine: while enjoyed all over the world, it is still identified with it’s cuisine of origin. Drinking chocolate, however, is not part of world cuisine, as it is seen as an integral part of many cuisines around the world, and is no longer associated with and identified as a part of its origin cuisine (which is the same as the origin of the taco). It is instead, an example of what I call *global cuisine*.

## Global or Fusion Cuisine

It is distinct from the concept of world cuisine - those cuisines that have, in one form or another, become widely appreciated far from their home. Global Cuisine is, instead, individual units of food production that have been completely decontextualized.

The Columbian Exchange resulted in a huge expansion of what could be considered global cuisine.

From the very basic and obvious (now) things like rice, potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, beef cattle, and chickens, world cuisine has steadily expanded from the 16th century.

Tacos, pizza, ramen, burgers, tofu, pasta, arroz con pollo, ricotta cheese, rice pudding… all of these are now truly world wide foods.

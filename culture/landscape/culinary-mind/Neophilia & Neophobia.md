{% epigraph 'People are very open-minded about new things - as long as they´re exactly like the old ones' 'Charles Kettering' 'Prophet of progress: selections from the speeches of Charles F. Kettering' %}

{% newthought 'A *neophile* is the opposite of a *neophobe*.'%}{% sidenote 'sn01' 'Neophile is a term popularized by one of my favorite authors: [Robert Anton Wilson](https://rawilson.com/)' %} While that might seem staggeringly obvious, the concept of the neophile is relatively new, at least relative to the idea of the neophobe.

This food nephobia{% sidenote 'sn02' 'The term *food neophobia* being a human-specific type of **dietary conservatism**, as it is called when discussing the behavior in a wider range of vertebrate species. It is, or was, also called *fussy* or *picky eating* in children.' %} has been described as the fear of eating new or unfamiliar foods. I would, however, avoid that kind of pathologizing talk (fear). Expecially given that not only do people with high food neophobia resist trying new food, they also rate new foods that they do try as lower than neophilics. That points to a strong preference for the familiar, not a distrust of the unfamiliar. It is very typical for people to generally have a distaste for new things and to prefer things that are familiar and common. No one thinks of this as a **fear**.

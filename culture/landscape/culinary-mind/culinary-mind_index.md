What I call the *culinary mind* is the set of both personal and culturally shared ideas and attitudes that inform and determine our food consumption behaviors. Think of these as the subconscious food rituals of our families and our cultures. Much more than outward rituals like religious prohibitions on certain foods or dishes associated so heavily with one holiday that it seems perverse to serve them any other time, the culinary mind is our buried culinary prejudices.[^2] Our culture, much more than our past experiences, determines our food preferences, particularly our expectations of liking or disliking certain foods.[^1]

These cultural and personal expectations, likes and dislikes, and comfort routines are as much a part of the culinary landscape as is the hillsides the apples grow on or the coves the fishing fleet leaves from.

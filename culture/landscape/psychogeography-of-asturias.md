Psychogeography describes the effect of a geographical location on the emotions and behavior of individuals. While most often associated with the ideas of urban exploration and critiques of the civic landscape of cities, it is, I believe, equally useful for interrogating the built environment of the Asturian culinary landscape. Underneath it's outer shell of subverting the tyranny of city planning, it is a toolbox for understanding the effect of the built environment on the behavior of its inhabitants.

## Psychogeography
Coming out of the Situationist International and heavily influenced by the French nineteenth century poet and writer Charles Baudelaire, the idea is:

{% blockquote 'Geography, for example, deals with the determinant action of general natural forces, such as soil composition or climatic conditions, on the economic structures of a society, and thus on the corresponding conception that such a society can have of the world. Psychogeography could set for itself the study of the precise laws and specific effects of the geographical environment, consciously organized or not, on the emotions and behavior of individuals.

The natural environment is the geography, the climate, the soil, the plants and animals, both native and adapted. The human animal is included in this insofar as their attitudes and predilections are shaped by their surroundings. We as humans have not completely mastered nature. We are not capable of simply growing whatever we like, wherever we like. There are no Himalayan bananas nor Ghanaian cranberries - at least not yet. Cows and chickens much prefer to live on warm grasslands than on frozen tundra. These, and a thousand other factors, large and small, determine what kinds of plants and animals can thrive in an area. They also determine what techniques or technologies humans will employ to exploit those natural communities. We can be trusted to always aim for the low hanging fruit first, both literally and metaphorically.

In this part of the site, I explore the various natural factors that contribute to Asturian gastronomy - the mountains that cover more than 80% of the region, the sea with it's myriad of coves perfect for fishing ports, it's rolling hills with temperate oceanic climate, its limestone caves... Each of these things in some way contributes to what makes Asturian food what it is, and to what makes it unique.

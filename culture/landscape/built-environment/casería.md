{% newthought 'The casería is the common name'%} in Asturias for a farmstead. In most usage, it denotes the farmhouse, along with all assorted other buildings and spaces, such as the antoxana, [hórreo](/culture/landscape/built-environment/hórreo-panera.html), cuadra, tool sheds, wood sheds, etc... It forms a single unit of agricultural production, residence, consumption, use, and storage. Also included are the associated orchards, fields, meadows, pastures, and communal land rights.[^1] The term does not describe a single unit of land with one boundary, but instead the functional areas making up a whole farm.[^2] The immediate area around the farmhouse formed by the closest buildings and land is (or at least was) called the _quintana_[^3] [^4] The space within the _quintana_ directly in front of the door to the house, and usually surrounded by the most important buildings is the _antoxana_.[^5] Often these words are used interchangeably, and most people would understand them as synonyms.

The rest of the farm — the fields and pastures for instance — are connected to the main house area, and each other, by farm roads (_caminos_) and walking paths (_caleyas_).
## History

Originally a medieval unit of farm land, owned by a noble or the church, the casería became owned directly by the peasants during the 16th century, whereas earlier they had been tenant farmers, and even earlier, they too were owned directly by the privileged classes.

Traditionally the inhabitants of a caserío would be a married couple, at least one set of their parents, and their children. Laws have existed in Asturias since at least 1781 to stop subdivision of caserías into smaller and smaller farms that cannot support anyone. This system of _mayorazgo_ inheritance lived on longer in western Asturias - centuries after it was enforceable law.[^6] One of the children (almost always the eldest son) could marry "_pa la casa_" - for the house. The other children would receive some compensation before leaving, or remain to help on the farm. Those who remained would usually build a new house adjacent to the inherited house, and slowly over time the casería might become a _caserío_ - a small hamlet. Many hamlets and even some small villages (_aldeas_) grew out of a consequence of this remaining after marrying.

## Asturian Customary Law

According to the customary laws of Asturias, collected and codified in 2007, a casería is:

{% blockquote 'BQ01' '_an economic and family-farm unit made up of dissociated elements, both in terms of their nature — house, antoxana , adjoining buildings and complementary constructions, hórreos or paneras, orchards, land, meadows, mountains, trees, animals, machinery and tools, farming and exploitation rights in communal property —, as well as its property system — private, leased or sharecropping —, its dispersed location and its destination or use — cultivation, harvesting, pasture —, which form a set agricultural unit capable of supporting a peasant family, without prejudice to the latter having other complementary sources of income._' '' 'Asturian Common Law' 'La Comisión Especial de Derecho Consuetudinario Asturiano. “Dictamen de la Comisión Especial de Derecho Consuetudinario Asturiano (06/0177/0001/00390).” _Junta General del Principado de Asturias_, vol. VI Legislatura, 455, 9 Mar. 2007, p. 48.' %}

## Common Parts of the Casería

A casería usually encompasses the following buildings and spaces:

- a farmhouse - usually of two floors, and containing an attic and/or a _corredor_; a (sometimes enclosed) windowed porch used to dry fruits, hang corn, or put out the washing.
- an _antoxana_ or _quintana_, a walled or fenced patio immediately outside the front door of the house.
- an _hórreo_ or _panera -_ a granary and storehouse for dried foods, designed to guard against humidity and rodents. Commonly the space below the hórreo is used to store farm implements and larger tools.
- a stable (_cuadra_), with or without a hayloft (_payar_).
- an apple orchard ([_pumarada_](/culture/landscape/built-environment/pumarada.html)) and possibly other orchards.
- one or more vegetable gardens (_huerto_ or _güertu_),[^7] normally placed close to the house, and planted with the various fruits and vegetables the family eats daily.
- one or more fields (_güerta_ or _tierres_) - Large fields planted with what we would call "field crops" in English: beans, cereals, potatoes, etc...
- one or more pastures (_praos_) - for grazing livestock.
- one or more _corras_ - a low stone wall, roughly circular where gathered chestnuts still in their shells are stored before processing.[^8]
- Other various outbuildings - hen houses, rabbit hutches, etc...

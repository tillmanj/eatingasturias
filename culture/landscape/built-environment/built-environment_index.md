The built environment is the changes we as humans have made to the landscape. Our farms, fields, houses, towns, cities, and infrastructure all become part of the wider culinary landscape. This is the area in which you see the most direct human impact on the culinary landscape, though that impact is in one way or another molded by the natural environment as well. At the point in time when most Asturian farms, towns, villages, and cities arose the technology did not exist to simply put a human habitation anywhere we wanted without considering the natural environment. There is no Asturian Las Vegas for instance (technically there are at least two them, but you get my point).

Here I explore all of the pieces of the landscape that make Asturias the agropolitan region that it is. From the iconic hórreos to the clusters of family farm buildings that grow into rural towns, and from the smaller size of the cities to the greater rural population density - the human landscape of Asturias is here. I am particularly interested in the individual buildings and how they come together into productive units.

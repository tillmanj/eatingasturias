{% newthought 'Strictly speaking,'%} a llagar is a cider press.[^2] However, as commonly used, in Asturias, a llagar can mean one of several things:
{% marginfigure 'mf01' 'assets/images/llagar_sobiganu.png' 'A drawing by José Maria Legazpi showing a *sobigañu* style cider press; common in Asturias for centuries, and still in use today.' %}
- a machine for pressing cider
- a building or space that is used for making cider
- a collection of equipment for making cider
- a company that makes cider[^1]

Here I am going to talk about the first three definitions, as they all come together on the *[casería](/culture/landscape/built-environment/casería.html)* to produce cider in a rural home setting. (The commercial *llagar* is something that I discuss [elsewhere](/visit/llagares/).)

## The Home Llagar
In a traditional casería there was almost always a llagar - a bodega for the making and storing of cider. The size and quality of the space and its implements determined by the size of the pumarada the caserío had, or the relative ingenuity of the owner. As the traditional farmstead practiced (as much as possible) a policy of autarky, the ability to produce one's own alcoholic beverage was just as important as the ability to produce one's own bread.

Ideally, the home llagar was situated facing north, was well ventilated, and dug into a hill to help keep it as cool as possible. It was build as large as practicable, in order to have sufficient room to work, and additional room to store multiple barrels and stacks of bottles of cider.

Inside this room would be an area or machine for chopping up apples, a press for extracting the juice, buckets and containers for catching the juice, and various barrels for fermenting the cider, as well as sufficient bottles for getting the family through the year.

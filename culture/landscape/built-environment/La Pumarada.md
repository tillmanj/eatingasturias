The growing of fruit, particularly apples, is an inseparable part of the [casería](/culture/landscape/built-environment/casería.html), both in actuality and in the popular imagination.[^1] One expression of the primacy of apples in fruit cultivation in Asturias is the existence of the word _pumarada_. No other orchard gets its own name, but apple orchards do.

As early as 793 the forerunner to the modern Asturian _pumarada_, the word _pomifera_ is found in the Ego Fakilo.[^2]  By the early part of the 13th century, _pumarada_ was the common term for an enclosed apple orchard.[^3]

## The Traditional Pumarada

The traditional Asturian apple orchard was an integrated agricultural space, as we like to call them these days.[^4] Full-size apple trees, often each tree being a different cultivar, were planted based on available space. Cows (and later sheep) were grazed beneath, both to control grass and to fertilize the trees. _Colemenas_, traditional beehives made from tree trunks, were dotted around the orchards.

## The Modern Pumarada

While it is possible to find traditional orchards in the small villages and caserías of Asturias these days, the most common pumarada now is a large industrial-scale affair. Like most orchards, apple orchards benefit from economies of scale, and have been growing steadily larger since the 18th century.[^5]

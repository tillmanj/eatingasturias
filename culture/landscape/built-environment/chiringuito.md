Asturias is blessed with more than 200 beaches. And most of them are very chill and quiet by the standards of the south or the east coasts of Spain. That is reflected in the types of beach bars - chiringuitos - you find in Asturias.

For those that might not be familiar with the chiringuito, let me introduce you.

A chiringuito is a very small bar, In Asturias almost always on a beach, that sells drinks, snacks, tapas, and sometimes small meals. They are invariably housed in no-frills buildings, often food trailers. Some have a wooden patio to sit on. Others have only some scattered tables and chairs on the sand or the grass. The more elaborate and permanent of them might be in a wooden shed or a converted building.

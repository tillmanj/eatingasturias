{% newthought 'Until 2018, Asturias was coal country.' %} Not only was coal mining the major employer in the region, it was woven into the fabric of daily life for everyone, not just the miners and their families. Most people heated their homes with coal stoves --- the *cocina de carbon* --- and cooked on those same stoves all winter. Indeed, one of the most popular of these types of stoves also served as a *calentador* (boiler) for heating radiators.

Miners accommodations came with *cocinas de carbon*, and pay included sacks of coal delivered to your home right up until the end of mining in 2018. 
{% marginnote 'mn01' 'As a matter of fact, coal deliveries continue to this day: as a result of the deal struck with the miners when the mines were closed, not only did their pensions begin immediately, but their coal deliveries were continued.' %}
Consumption of coal in Spain has dropped by more than 80% since that year. As consumption has dropped, the name of the stove has changed as well; more people call it a *cocina de leña* than a *concina de carbon* now.

## Continuing Popularity

{% marginnote 'mn02' 'If you live in the United States and are interested in wood stoves, you might know the brand [Hearthstone](https://www.hearthstonestoves.com/wood/wood-stoves/). That is Hergom under another name.' %} [Hergom](https://www.hergom.com/productos/categoria-23-Cocinas-de-lena) is the by far the most popular brand. That is, judging by what I have seen in four years of inspecting kitchens in homes across Asturias. And while many houses already have such a stove, there is enough of a market for new ones that the foundry continues to manufacture them now. Sure, only two of their current models are rated for coal burning. But there are still almost three dozen options to choose from for a wood stove.

Surprisingly, Hergom was only founded in 1960. Meaning that by most standards, the stoves I see in houses here are new. These are not antiques – relics of “back in grandma’s day”. These are consciously chosen “daily driver” cook tops and ovens, designed for current needs and desires.

In the States cooking on a wood stove is a very niche activity. It is mostly confined to “back to the land” and “off grid prepper” types there. Whereas in Asturias it is a normal part of daily life for close to a third of the population. The reasons for this are simple to see once you live here for a while.

First, electricity is wildly expensive compared to the United States. Moving to Spain from North Carolina was a real shock. Electricity prices went from 11 cents per kWh to over 30 cents per kWh! Indeed, Spanish electricity prices are among the highest in Europe, and thus in the world. This explains why electric stoves and ovens are not as common here as in the US.

Municipal natural gas is also more expensive in Spain than in the US. Indeed, it is more than twice as costly. It is also not as widely available. Both of these facts are because of a simple fact. The United States is [totally energy independent](https://www.enerdata.net/estore/energy-market/united-states.html). That is, it generates at least 100% of the energy it consumes. Spain, on the other hand produces only about [30% of the energy](https://www.enerdata.net/estore/energy-market/spain/) it consumes. Availability, and pricing, of electricity and gas in Spain are largely dependent on foreign suppliers, and are thus at the mercy of international politics, regional economics, and speculators of all kinds.

In that environment, it is easy to see why those who could would hedge their bets and maintain a way to heat their houses and cook during the cold months that wasn’t reliant on those energy supplies.

This process of decarbonization then switched to closing coal-fired power plants. This is a huge shock to the system in Asturias. Coal mining in Asturias has been the largest industry, by far, since the end of the eighteenth century. Indeed, daily life in much of Asturias revolved around coal for more than 200 years.[^1] A standard part of a coal miners pay in Asturias was, right up until the end of the coal industry, free coal for home use. Hence the proliferation of _policombustible_ stoves throughout Asturias. Why would anyone use the expensive electricity or the less convenient bottled gas when coal was going to be provided for free?[^2]

As coal has waned in importance in Asturias, the coal-fired cook stove has slowly transitioned to being solely wood-fired. But the problems of electricity and natural gas remain, and so the stove continues to be front and center in the daily lives of many Asturians.

Honestly, I personally hope that it continues. I much prefer cooking over wood, and I am very happy to be in a place where that is a normal thing..
